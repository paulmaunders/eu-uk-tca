
## TITLE VII: SURRENDER

##### Article LAW.SURR.76: Objective
The objective of this Title is to ensure that the extradition system between the Member States, on the one side, and the United Kingdom, on the other side, is based on a mechanism of surrender pursuant to an arrest warrant in accordance with the terms of this Title.

##### Article LAW.SURR.77: Principle of proportionality
Cooperation through the arrest warrant shall be necessary and proportionate, taking into account the rights of the requested person and the interests of the victims, and having regard to the seriousness of the act, the likely penalty that would be imposed and the possibility of a State taking measures less coercive than the surrender of the requested person particularly with a view to avoiding unnecessarily long periods of pre-trial detention.

##### Article LAW.SURR.78: Definitions
For the purposes of this Title, the following definitions apply:
    (a) “arrest warrant” means a judicial decision issued by a State with a view to the arrest and surrender by another State of a requested person, for the purposes of conducting a criminal prosecution or executing a custodial sentence or detention order;
    (b) “judicial authority” means an authority that is, under domestic law, a judge, a court or a public prosecutor. A public prosecutor is considered a judicial authority only to the extent that domestic law so provides;
    (c.) “executing judicial authority” means the judicial authority of the executing State which is competent to execute the arrest warrant by virtue of the domestic law of that State;
    (d) “issuing judicial authority” means the judicial authority of the issuing State which is competent to issue an arrest warrant by virtue of the domestic law of that State.

    (a) if the offence on which the arrest warrant is based is covered by an amnesty in the executing State, where that State had jurisdiction to prosecute the offence under its own criminal law;
    (b) if the executing judicial authority is informed that the requested person has been finally judged by a State in respect of the same acts, provided that, if a penalty has been imposed, it has been enforced, is in the process of being enforced or can no longer be enforced under the law of the sentencing State; or
    (c.) if the person who is the subject of the arrest warrant may not, owing to the person’s age, be held criminally responsible for the acts on which the arrest warrant is based under the law of the executing State.

##### Article LAW.SURR.81: Other grounds for non-execution of the arrest warrant
1. The execution of the arrest warrant may be refused:
    (a) if, in one of the cases referred to in Article LAW.SURR.79(2) [Scope], the act on which the arrest warrant is based does not constitute an offence under the law of the executing State; however, in relation to taxes or duties, customs and exchange, the execution of the arrest warrant shall not be refused on the grounds that the law of the executing State does not impose the same kind of tax or duty or does not contain the same type of rules as regards taxes or duties, customs and exchange regulations as the law of the issuing State;
    (b) if the person who is the subject of the arrest warrant is being prosecuted in the executing State for the same act as that on which the arrest warrant is based;
    (c.) if the judicial authorities of the executing State have decided either not to prosecute for the offence on which the arrest warrant is based or to halt proceedings, or if a final judgment which prevents further proceedings has been passed upon the requested person in a State in respect of the same acts;
    (d) if the criminal prosecution or punishment of the requested person is statute-barred under the law of the executing State and the acts fall within the jurisdiction of that State under its own criminal law;
    (e) if the executing judicial authority is informed that the requested person has been finally judged by a third country in respect of the same acts provided that, if a penalty has been imposed, it has been enforced, is in the process of being enforced or can no longer be enforced under the law of the sentencing country;
    (f) if the arrest warrant has been issued for the purposes of execution of a custodial sentence or detention order and the requested person is staying in, or is a national or a resident of the executing State and that State undertakes to execute the sentence or detention order in accordance with its domestic law; if consent of the requested person to the transfer of the sentence or detention order to the executing State is required, the executing State may refuse to execute the arrest warrant only after the requested person consents to the transfer of the sentence or detention order;
    (g) if the arrest warrant relates to offences which:
        (i) are regarded by the law of the executing State as having been committed in whole or in part in the territory of the executing State or in a place treated as such or
        (ii) have been committed outside the territory of the issuing State, and the law of the executing State does not allow prosecution for the same offences if committed outside its territory;
    (h) if there are reasons to believe on the basis of objective elements that the arrest warrant has been issued for the purpose of prosecuting or punishing a person on the grounds the person’s sex, race, religion, ethnic origin, nationality, language, political opinions or sexual orientation, or that that person’s position may be prejudiced for any of those reasons;
    (i) if the arrest warrant has been issued for the purpose of executing a custodial sentence or a detention order and the requested person did not appear in person at the trial resulting in the decision, unless the arrest warrant states that the person, in accordance with further procedural requirements defined in the domestic law of the issuing State:
        (i) in due time:
            (A) either was summoned in person and thereby informed of the scheduled date and place of the trial which resulted in the decision, or by other means actually received official information of the scheduled date and place of that trial in such a manner that it was unequivocally established that the person was aware of the date and place of the scheduled trial;
            and
            (B) was informed that a decision may be handed down if that person did not appear for the trial;
        or
        (ii) being aware of the date and place of the scheduled trial, had given a mandate to a lawyer, who was either appointed by the person concerned or by the State, to defend him or her at the trial, and was indeed defended by that lawyer at the trial;
        or
        (iii) after being served with the decision and being expressly informed about the right to a retrial or appeal in which the person has the right to participate and which allows the merits of the case, including fresh evidence, to be re-examined, and which may lead to the original decision being reversed:
            (A) expressly stated that the person did not contest the decision;
            or
            (B) did not request a retrial or appeal within the applicable time frame;
            or
            (iv) was not personally served with the decision but:
                (A) will be personally served with it without delay after the surrender and will be expressly informed of the right to a retrial or appeal in which the person has the right to participate and which allows the merits of the case, including fresh evidence, to be re-examined, and which may lead to the original decision being reversed;
                and
                (B) will be informed of the time frame within which the person has to request such a retrial or appeal, as mentioned in the relevant arrest warrant.

2. Where the arrest warrant is issued for the purpose of executing a custodial sentence or detention order under the conditions in point (i) (iv) of paragraph 1 and the person concerned has not previously received any official information about the existence of the criminal proceedings against him or her, that person may, when being informed about the content of the arrest warrant, request to receive a copy of the judgment before being surrendered. Immediately after having been informed about the request, the issuing authority shall provide the copy of the judgment via the executing authority to the person concerned. The request of the person concerned shall neither delay the surrender procedure nor delay the decision to execute the arrest warrant. The provision of the judgment to the person concerned shall be for information purposes only; it shall not be regarded as a formal service of the judgment nor actuate any time limits applicable for requesting a retrial or appeal.

3. Where a person is surrendered under the conditions in point (i) (iv) of paragraph 1 and that person has requested a retrial or appeal, until those proceedings are finalised the detention of that person awaiting such retrial or appeal shall be reviewed in accordance with the domestic law of the issuing State, either on a regular basis or upon request of the person concerned.

##### Article LAW.SURR.82: Political offence exception

In such a case, the Union, on behalf of any of its Member States or the United Kingdom, as the case may be, may notify the Specialised Committee on Law Enforcement and Judicial Cooperation within a reasonable time after the receipt of the other Party’s notification that the executing judicial authorities of the Member State or the United Kingdom, as the case may be, may refuse to surrender its nationals to that State or that surrender shall be authorised only under certain specified conditions.

3. In circumstances where a State has refused to execute an arrest warrant on the basis that, in the case of the United Kingdom, it has made a notification or, in the case of a Member State, the Union has made a notification on its behalf, as referred to in paragraph 2, that State shall consider instituting proceedings against its own national which are commensurate with the subject matter of the arrest warrant, having taken into account the views of the issuing State. In circumstances where a judicial authority decides not to institute such proceedings, the victim of the offence on which the arrest warrant is based shall be able to receive information on the decision in accordance with the applicable domestic law.

4. Where a State’s competent authorities institute proceedings against its own national in accordance with paragraph 3, that State shall ensure that its competent authorities are able to take appropriate measures to assist the victims and witnesses in circumstances where they are residents of another State, particularly with regard to the way in which the proceedings are conducted.

    (b) if a person who is the subject of an arrest warrant for the purposes of prosecution is a national or resident of the executing State, the surrender of that person may be subject to the condition that the person, after being heard, is returned to the executing State in order to serve there the custodial sentence or detention order passed against him or her in the issuing State; if the consent of the requested person to the transfer of the sentence or detention order to the executing State is required, the guarantee that the person be returned to the executing State to serve the person’s sentence is subject to the condition that the requested person, after being heard, consents to be returned to the executing State;

##### Article LAW.SURR.102: Postponed or conditional surrender
1. After deciding to execute the arrest warrant, the executing judicial authority may postpone the surrender of the requested person so that the requested person may be prosecuted in the executing State or, if the requested person has already been sentenced, so that the requested person may serve, a sentence passed for an act other than that referred to in the arrest warrant in the territory of the executing State.

2. Instead of postponing the surrender, the executing judicial authority may temporarily surrender the requested person to the issuing State under conditions to be determined by mutual agreement between the executing and the issuing judicial authorities. The agreement shall be made in writing and the conditions shall be binding on all the authorities in the issuing State.

##### Article LAW.SURR.103: Transit
1. Each State shall permit the transit through its territory of a requested person who is being surrendered provided that it has been given information on:
    (a) the identity and nationality of the person subject to the arrest warrant;
    (b) the existence of an arrest warrant;
    (c) the nature and legal classification of the offence; and
    (d) the description of the circumstances of the offence, including the date and place.

2. The State, on behalf of which a notification has been made in accordance with Article LAW.SURR.83(2) [Nationality exception] to the effect that its own nationals will not be surrendered or that surrender will be authorised only under certain specified conditions, may refuse the transit of its own nationals through its territory under the same terms or submit it to the same conditions.

3. The States shall designate an authority responsible for receiving transit requests and the necessary documents, as well as any other official correspondence relating to transit requests.

4. The transit request and the information referred to in paragraph 1 may be addressed to the authority designated pursuant to paragraph 3 by any means capable of producing a written record. The State of transit shall notify its decision by the same procedure.

5. This Article does not apply in the case of transport by air without a scheduled stopover. However, if an unscheduled landing occurs, the issuing State shall provide the authority designated pursuant to paragraph 3 with the information referred to in paragraph 1.

6. Where a transit concerns a person who is to be extradited from a third country to a State, this Article applies mutatis mutandis. In particular, references to an “arrest warrant” shall be treated as references to an “extradition request”.

##### Article LAW.SURR.104: Deduction of the period of detention served in the executing State
1. The issuing State shall deduct all periods of detention arising from the execution of an arrest warrant from the total period of detention to be served in the issuing State as a result of a custodial sentence or detention order being passed.

2. All information concerning the duration of the detention of the requested person on the basis of the arrest warrant shall be transmitted by the executing judicial authority or the central authority designated under Article LAW.SURR.85 [Recourse to the central authority] to the issuing judicial authority at the time of the surrender.

##### Article LAW.SURR.105: Possible prosecution for other offences
1. The United Kingdom and the Union, acting on behalf of any of its Member States, may each notify the Specialised Committee on Law Enforcement and Judicial Cooperation that, in relations with other States to which the same notification applies, consent is presumed to have been given for the prosecution, sentencing or detention of a person with a view to the carrying out of a custodial sentence or detention order for an offence committed prior to the person’s surrender, other than that for which that person was surrendered, unless in a particular case the executing judicial authority states otherwise in its decision on surrender.

2. Except in the cases referred to in paragraphs 1 and 3, a person surrendered may not be prosecuted, sentenced or otherwise deprived of liberty for an offence committed prior to that person's surrender other than that for which the person was surrendered.

3. Paragraph 2 of this Article does not apply in the following cases:
    (a) the person, having had an opportunity to leave the territory of the State to which that person has been surrendered, has not done so within 45 days of that person's final discharge or has returned to that territory after leaving it;
    (b) the offence is not punishable by a custodial sentence or detention order;
    (c.) the criminal proceedings do not give rise to the application of a measure restricting personal liberty;
    (d) the person could be liable to a penalty or a measure not involving the deprivation of liberty, in particular a financial penalty or a measure in lieu of a financial penalty, even if the penalty or measure may give rise to a restriction of the person’s personal liberty;
    (e) the person consented to be surrendered, where appropriate at the same time as the person renounced the speciality rule, in accordance with Article LAW.SURR.91 [Consent to surrender];
    (f) the person, after the person's surrender, has expressly renounced entitlement to the speciality rule with regard to specific offences preceding the person's surrender; renunciation must be given before the competent judicial authority of the issuing State and be recorded in accordance with that State's domestic law; the renunciation must be drawn up in such a way as to make clear that the person concerned has given it voluntarily and in full awareness of the consequences; to that end, the person shall have the right to a lawyer; and
    (g) the executing judicial authority which surrendered the person gives its consent in accordance with paragraph 4 of this Article.

4. A request for consent shall be submitted to the executing judicial authority, accompanied by the information referred to in Article LAW.SURR.86(1) [Content and form of the arrest warrant] and a translation as referred to in Article LAW.SURR.86(2) [Content and form of the arrest warrant]. Consent shall be given where the offence for which it is requested is itself subject to surrender in accordance with the provisions of this Title. Consent shall be refused on the grounds referred to in Article LAW.SURR.80 [Grounds for mandatory non-execution of the arrest warrant] and otherwise may be refused only on the grounds referred to in Article LAW.SURR.81 [Other grounds for non-execution of the arrest warrant], or Article LAW.SURR.82(2) [Political offence exception] and Article LAW.SURR.83(2) [Nationality exception]. The decision shall be taken no later than 30 days after receipt of the request. For the situations laid down in Article LAW.SURR.84 [Guarantees to be given by the issuing State in particular cases] the issuing State must give the guarantees provided for therein.

##### Article LAW.SURR.106: Surrender or subsequent extradition
1. The United Kingdom and the Union, acting on behalf of any of its Member States, may each notify the Specialised Committee on Law Enforcement and Judicial Cooperation that, in relations with other States to which the same notification applies, the consent for the surrender of a person to a State other than the executing State pursuant to an arrest warrant or European arrest warrant issued for an offence committed prior to that person's surrender is presumed to have been given, unless in a particular case the executing judicial authority states otherwise in its decision on surrender.

2. In any case, a person who has been surrendered to the issuing State pursuant to an arrest warrant or European arrest warrant may be surrendered to a State other than the executing State pursuant to an arrest warrant or European arrest warrant issued for any offence committed prior to the person’s surrender without the consent of the executing State in the following cases:
    (a) the requested person, having had an opportunity to leave the territory of the State to which that person has been surrendered, has not done so within 45 days of that person's final discharge, or has returned to that territory after leaving it;

    (c.) the requested person is not subject to the speciality rule, in accordance with points (a), (e), (f) or (g) of Article LAW.SURR.105(3) [Possible prosecution for other offences].

3. The executing judicial authority shall consent to the surrender to another State in accordance with the following rules:
    (a) the request for consent shall be submitted in accordance with Article LAW.SURR.87 [Transmission of an arrest warrant], accompanied by the information set out in Article LAW.SURR.86(1) [Content and form of the arrest warrant] and a translation as referred to in Article LAW.SURR.86(2) [Content and form of the arrest warrant];
    (b) consent shall be given where the offence for which it is requested is itself subject to surrender in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement;
    (c.) the decision shall be taken no later than 30 days after receipt of the request; and
    (d) consent shall be refused on the grounds referred to in Article LAW.SURR.80 [Grounds for mandatory non-execution of the arrest warrant] and otherwise may be refused only on the grounds referred to in Article LAW.SURR.81 [Other grounds for non-execution of the arrest warrant], Article LAW.SURR.82(2) [Political offence exception] and Article LAW.SURR.83(2) [Nationality exception].

4. For the situations referred to in Article LAW.SURR.84 [Guarantees to be given by the issuing State in particular cases], the issuing State shall give the guarantees provided for therein.

5. Notwithstanding paragraph 1, a person who has been surrendered pursuant to an arrest warrant shall not be extradited to a third country without the consent of the competent authority of the State which surrendered the person. Such consent shall be given in accordance with the Conventions by which that State is bound, as well as with its domestic law.

##### Article LAW.SURR.107: Handing over of property
1. At the request of the issuing judicial authority or on its own initiative, the executing judicial authority shall, in accordance with its domestic law, seize and hand over property which:
    (a) may be required as evidence; or
    (b) has been acquired by the requested person as a result of the offence.

2. The property referred to in paragraph 1 shall be handed over even if the arrest warrant cannot be carried out owing to the death or escape of the requested person.

3. If the property referred to in paragraph 1 is liable to seizure or confiscation in the territory of the executing State, that State may, if the property is needed in connection with pending criminal proceedings, temporarily retain it or hand it over to the issuing State on condition that it is returned.

4. Any rights which the executing State or third parties may have acquired in the property referred to in paragraph 1 shall be preserved. Where such rights exist, the issuing State shall return the property without charge to the executing State as soon as the criminal proceedings have been terminated.

##### Article LAW.SURR.108: Expenses
1. Expenses incurred in the territory of the executing State for the execution of an arrest warrant shall be borne by that State.

2. All other expenses shall be borne by the issuing State.

##### Article LAW.SURR.109: Relation to other legal instruments
1. Without prejudice to their application in relations between States and third countries, this Title, from the date of entry into force of this Agreement, replaces the corresponding provisions of the following conventions applicable in the field of extradition in relations between the United Kingdom, on the one side, and Member States, on the other side:
    (a) the European Convention on Extradition, done at Paris on 13 December 1957, and its additional protocols; and
    (b) the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism, as far as extradition is concerned.

2. Where the Conventions referred to in paragraph 1 apply to the territories of States or to territories for whose external relations a State is responsible to which this Title does not apply, those Conventions continue to govern the relations existing between those territories and the other States.

If the notifications referred to in Article LAW.SURR.83(2) [Nationality exception] are not renewed, they shall expire five years after the date of entry into force of this Agreement. Notifications as referred to in Article LAW.SURR.83(2) [Nationality exception] may only be renewed or newly made during the three months prior to the fifth anniversary of the entry into force of this Agreement and, subsequently, every five years thereafter, provided that the conditions set out in Article LAW.SURR.83(2) [Nationality exception] are met at that time.

##### Article LAW.SURR.111: Ongoing arrest warrants in case of disapplication
Notwithstanding Article LAW.GEN.5 [Scope of cooperation where a Member State no longer participates in analogous measure under Union law]; Article.LAW.OTHER.136 [Termination] and Article LAW.OTHER.137 [Suspension], the provisions of this Title apply in respect of arrest warrants where the requested person was arrested before the disapplication of this Title for the purposes of the execution of an arrest warrant, irrespective of the decision of the executing judicial authority as to whether the requested person is to remain in detention or be provisionally released.
