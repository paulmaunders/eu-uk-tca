##### Article X+6: Authorisation procedure
1. Authorisations shall be issued in agreement with the competent authorities in the Parties in whose territory passengers are picked up or set down. The authorising authority shall forward to such competent authorities, as well as to the competent authorities whose territories are crossed without passengers being picked up or set down, a copy of the application, together with copies of any other relevant documentation, and its assessment.
In respect of the Union, the competent authorities referred to in the first part of this paragraph shall be those of the Member States in whose territories passengers are picked up or set down and whose territories are crossed without passengers being picked up or set down.

2. The competent authorities whose agreement has been requested shall notify the authorising authority of their decision regarding the application within four months. This time limit shall be calculated from the date of receipt of the request for agreement which is shown in the acknowledgement of receipt. If the decision received from the competent authorities whose agreement has been requested is negative, it shall contain a proper statement of reasons. If the authorising authority does not receive a reply within four months, the competent authorities consulted shall be deemed to have given their agreement and the authorising authority may grant the authorisation.
The competent authorities whose territory is crossed without passengers being picked up or set down may notify the authorising authority of their comments within four months.

3. In respect of services that had been authorised under Regulation (EC) No 1073/2009 of the European Parliament and Council^70 before the end of the transition period and in respect of which the authorisation lapses at the end of the transition period, the following shall apply:
    (a) where, subject to the changes necessary to comply with Article X+2, the operating conditions are the same as those having been set in the authorisation granted under Regulation (EC) No 1073/2009, the relevant authorising authority under this Title may, on application or otherwise, issue the road transport operator with a corresponding authorisation granted under this Title. Where such an authorisation is issued, the agreement of the competent authorities in whose territories passengers are picked up or set down, as referred to in paragraph 2, shall be deemed to be provided. Those competent authorities and the competent authorities whose territory is crossed without passengers being picked up or set down may, at any time, notify the authorising authority of any comments they may have;
    (b) where point (a) is applied, the validity period of the corresponding authorisation granted under this Title shall not extend beyond the last day of the validity period specified in the authorisation previously granted under Regulation (EC) No 1073/2009.

4. The authorising authority shall take a decision on the application no later than six months from the date of submission of the application by the road passenger transport operator.

5. Authorisation shall be granted unless:
    (a) the applicant is unable to provide the service which is the subject of the application with equipment directly available to the applicant;
    (b) the applicant has not complied with national or international legislation on road transport, and in particular the conditions and requirements relating to authorisations for international road passenger services, or has committed serious infringements of a Party's road transport legislation in particular with regard to the rules applicable to vehicles and driving and rest periods for drivers;
    (c.) in the case of an application for renewal of authorisation, the conditions of authorisation have not been complied with;
    (d) a Party decides on the basis of a detailed analysis that the service concerned would seriously affect the viability of a comparable service covered by one or more public service contracts conforming to the Party's law on the direct sections concerned. In such a case, the Party shall set up criteria, on a non-discriminatory basis, for determining whether the service applied for would seriously affect the viability of the abovementioned comparable service and shall communicate them to the other Party referred to in paragraph 1; or
    (e) a Party decides on the basis of a detailed analysis that the principal purpose of the service is not to carry passengers between stops located in the territories of the Parties.
(^70) Regulation (EC) No 1073/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 October 2009 on common rules for access to the international market for coach and bus services, and amending Regulation (EC) No 561/2006 (recast) (OJ EU L 300, 14.11.2009, p. 88).

In the event that an existing service seriously affects the viability of a comparable service covered by one or more public service contracts which conform to a Party's law on the direct sections concerned, due to exceptional reasons which could not have been foreseen at the time of granting the authorisation, a Party may, with the agreement of the other Party, suspend or withdraw the authorisation to run the international coach and bus service after having given six months' notice to the road passenger transport operator .
The fact that a road passenger transport operator of a Party offers lower prices than those offered by other road passenger transport operators or the fact that the link in question is already operated by other road passenger transport operators shall not in itself constitute justification for rejecting the application.

6. Having completed the procedure laid down in paragraphs 1 to 5, the authorising authority shall grant the authorisation or formally refuse the application.
Decisions rejecting an application shall state the reasons on which they are based. The Parties shall ensure that transport undertakings are given the opportunity to make representations in the event of their application being rejected.
The authorising authority shall inform the competent authorities of the other Party of its decision and shall send them a copy of any authorisation.

##### Article X+7: Renewal and alteration of authorisation
1. Article X+6 shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to applications for the renewal of authorisations or for alteration of the conditions under which the services subject to authorisation must be carried out.

2. Where the existing authorisation expires within six months from the date of entry into force of this Agreement, the period of time in which the competent authorities referred to in Article X+6(2) shall notify the authorising authority of their agreement to, or comments on, the application in accordance with that Article, is two months.

3. In the event of a minor alteration to the operating conditions, in particular the adjustment of intervals, fares and timetables, the authorising authority needs only supply the competent authorities of the other Party with information relating to the alteration. Changing the timetables or intervals in a manner that affects the timing of controls at the borders between the Parties or at third country borders shall not be considered a minor alteration.

##### Article X+8: Lapse of an authorisation
1. Without prejudice to Article X+6(3), an authorisation for a service referred to in Article X+2 shall lapse at the end of its period of validity or three months after the authorising authority has received notice from its holder of his or her intention to withdraw the service.

2. Without prejudice to paragraph 1 as well as to Article X+4(8), in the case of a special regular service, the contract between the organiser and the road passenger transport operator or a copy thereof as well as a document evidencing that the passengers constitute a specific category to the exclusion of other passengers for the purposes of a special regular service shall also serve as control documents, shall be kept in the vehicle and shall be presented at the request of any authorised inspecting officer.

3. Road passenger transport operators carrying out occasional services under Article X+2(6) and (7) shall carry a completed journey form, using the model in Annex ROAD-4.
