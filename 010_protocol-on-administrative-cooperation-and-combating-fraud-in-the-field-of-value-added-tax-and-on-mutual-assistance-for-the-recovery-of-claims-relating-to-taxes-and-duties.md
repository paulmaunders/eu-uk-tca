_This document has been agreed between the European Union and the United Kingdom and is provided for information only.
No rights may be derived from it until the date of application. The numbering of the articles is provisional._

powers and procedures provided under the laws, regulations or administrative provisions of that State applying to its claims except where otherwise provided for in this Protocol.

The State of the requested authority shall recover the claim in its own currency.

2. The requested authority shall inform the applicant authority with due diligence of any action it has taken on the request for recovery.

3. From the date on which the recovery request is received, the requested authority shall charge interest for late payment in accordance with the laws, regulations and administrative provisions applicable to its own claims.

5. Without prejudice to paragraph 1 of Article 35 [Costs], the requested authority shall remit to the applicant authority the amounts recovered with respect to the claim and the interest referred to in paragraphs 3 and 4 of this Article.

### Article 29: Disputed claims and enforcement measures
1. Disputes concerning the claim, the initial instrument permitting enforcement in the State of the applicant authority or the uniform instrument permitting enforcement in the State of the requested authority and disputes concerning the validity of a notification made by an applicant authority shall fall within the competence of the competent bodies of the State of the applicant authority. If, in the course of the recovery procedure, the claim, the initial instrument permitting enforcement in the State of the applicant authority or the uniform instrument permitting enforcement in the State of the requested authority is contested by an interested party, the requested authority shall inform that party that such an action must be brought by the latter before the competent body of the State of the applicant authority in accordance with the laws in force there.

The applicant authority may, in accordance with the laws, regulations and administrative practices in force in its State, ask the requested authority to recover a contested claim or the contested part of a claim, in so far as the laws, regulations and administrative practices in force in the State of the requested authority allow. Any such request shall be reasoned.

The requested authority shall then proceed with further recovery measures on the basis of the revised instrument.

Recovery or precautionary measures already taken on the basis of the original uniform instrument permitting enforcement in the State of the requested authority may be continued on the basis of the revised instrument, unless the amendment of the request is due to invalidity of the initial instrument permitting enforcement in the State of the applicant authority or the original uniform instrument permitting enforcement in the State of the requested authority.

Articles 27 [Instruments permitting enforcement in the State of the requested authority and other accompanying documents] and 29 [Disputed claims and enforcement measures] shall apply in relation to the revised instrument.

### Article 31: Request for precautionary measures
1. At the request of the applicant authority, the requested authority shall take precautionary measures, if allowed by its national law and in accordance with its administrative practices, to ensure recovery where a claim or the instrument permitting enforcement in the State of the applicant authority is contested at the time when the request is made, or where the claim is not yet the subject of an instrument permitting enforcement in the State of the applicant authority, in so far as precautionary measures are possible in a similar situation under the law and administrative practices of the State of the applicant authority.

2. The request for precautionary measures may be accompanied by other documents relating to the claim.

### Article 33: Limits to the requested authority’s obligation
1. The requested authority shall not be obliged to grant the assistance provided for in Articles 25 [Request for recovery] to 31 [Request for precautionary measures] if recovery of the claim would, because of the situation of the debtor, create serious economic or social difficulties in the State of the requested authority, in so far as the laws, regulations and administrative practices in force in that State allow such exception for national claims.

2. The requested authority shall not be obliged to grant the assistance provided for in Articles 25 [Request for recovery] to 31 [Request for precautionary measures] where the costs or administrative burdens for the requested State would be clearly disproportionate to the monetary benefit to be derived by the applicant State.

3. The requested authority shall not be obliged to grant the assistance provided for in Article 20 [Request for information] and Articles 22 [Presence in administrative offices and participation in administrative enquiries] to 31 [Request for precautionary measures] if the initial request for assistance pursuant to Article 20 [Request for information], 22 [Presence in administrative offices and participation in administrative enquiries], 23 [Request for notification of certain documents relating to claims], 25 [Request for recovery] or 31 [Request for precautionary measures] is made in respect of claims which are more than 5 years old, dating from the due date of the claim in the State of the applicant authority to the date of the initial request for assistance.

However, in cases where the claim or the initial instrument permitting enforcement in the State of the applicant authority is contested, the 5-year period shall be deemed to begin from the moment when it is established in the State of the applicant authority that the claim or the instrument permitting enforcement may no longer be contested.

Moreover, in cases where a postponement of the payment or payment by instalments arrangement has been granted by the State of the applicant authority, the 5-year period shall be deemed to begin from the moment when the entire extended payment period has come to its end.

However, in those cases the requested authority shall not be obliged to grant assistance in respect of claims which are more than 10 years old, dating from the due date of the claim in the State of the applicant authority.

_This document has been agreed between the European Union and the United Kingdom and is provided for information only.

5. The requested authority shall inform the applicant authority of the grounds for refusing a request for assistance.

### Article 34: Questions on limitation
1. Questions concerning periods of limitation shall be governed solely by the laws in force in the State of the applicant authority.

2. In relation to the suspension, interruption or prolongation of periods of limitation, any steps taken in the recovery of claims by or on behalf of the requested authority in pursuance of a request for assistance which have the effect of suspending, interrupting or prolonging the period of limitation according to the laws in force in the State of the requested authority shall have the same effect in the State of the applicant authority, on condition that the corresponding effect is provided for under the law of the latter State.

If suspension, interruption or prolongation of the period of limitation is not possible under the laws in force in the State of the requested authority, any steps taken in the recovery of claims by or on behalf of the requested authority in pursuance of a request for assistance which, if they had been carried out by or on behalf of the applicant authority in its own State, would have had the effect of suspending, interrupting or prolonging the period of limitation according to the laws of that State shall be deemed to have been taken in the latter State, in so far as that effect is concerned.

The first and second subparagraphs shall not affect the right of the State of the applicant authority to take measures which have the effect of suspending, interrupting or prolonging the period of limitation in accordance with the laws in force in that State.

3. The applicant authority and the requested authority shall inform each other of any action which interrupts, suspends or prolongs the limitation period of the claim for which the recovery or precautionary measures were requested, or which may have this effect.

### Article 35: Costs
1. In addition to the amounts referred to in paragraph 5 of Article 28 [Execution of the request for recovery], the requested authority shall seek to recover from the person concerned and retain the costs linked to the recovery that it incurred, in accordance with the laws and regulations of its State.2. The States shall renounce all claims on each other for the reimbursement of costs arising from any mutual assistance they grant each other pursuant to this Protocol.

2. However, where recovery creates a specific problem, concerns a very large amount in costs or relates to organised crime, the applicant and requested authorities may agree reimbursement arrangements specific to the cases in question.

3. Notwithstanding paragraph 2, the State of the applicant authority shall be liable to the State of the requested authority for any costs and any losses incurred as a result of actions held to be unfounded, as far as either the substance of the claim or the validity of the instrument permitting enforcement and/or 
precautionary measures issued by the applicant authority are concerned.

1. All requests for assistance, standard forms for notification and uniform instruments permitting enforcement in the State of the requested authority shall be sent in, or shall be accompanied by a translation into, the official language, or one of the official languages, of the State of the requested authority. The fact that certain parts thereof are written in a language other than the official language, or one of the official languages, of that State, shall not affect their validity or the validity of the procedure, in so far as that other language is one agreed between the States concerned.

2. The documents for which notification is requested pursuant to Article 23 [Request for notification of certain documents relating to claims] may be sent to the requested authority in an official language of the State of the applicant authority.

### Section 3 : Recovery assistance
### Article 3.1: Communication
A request sent by electronic means for the application of Title III of the Protocol shall be sent between the CCN mailboxes that are set up for the type of tax or duty to which the request relates, unless the central liaison offices of the applicant and requested States agree that one of the mailboxes can be used for requests concerning different types of taxes or duties.

However, if a request for notification of documents relates to more than one type of tax or duty, the applicant authority shall send that request to a mailbox set up for at least one of the types of claims mentioned in the documents to be notified.

### Article 3.2: Implementing rules relating to the uniform instrument permitting enforcement in the requested State
1. The administrative penalties, fines, fees and surcharges and the interest and costs referred to in point (b) of paragraph 1 of Article 2 of the Protocol which, in accordance with the rules in force in the applicant State, may be due from the date of the initial instrument permitting enforcement until the day before the date on which the recovery request is sent, may be added in the uniform instrument permitting enforcement in the requested State.

2. A single uniform instrument permitting enforcement in the requested State may be issued in respect of several claims and several persons, corresponding to the initial instrument or instruments permitting enforcement in the applicant State.

3. In so far as initial instruments permitting enforcement for several claims in the applicant State have already been replaced by a global instrument permitting enforcement for all those claims in that State, the uniform instrument permitting enforcement in the requested State may be based on the initial instruments permitting enforcement in the applicant State or on that global instrument regrouping those initial instruments in the applicant State.

4. Where the initial instrument referred to in paragraph 2 or the global instrument referred to in paragraph 3 contains several claims, one or more of which have already been collected or

_This document has been agreed between the European Union and the United Kingdom and is provided for information only.

recovered, the uniform instrument permitting enforcement in the requested State shall only refer to those claims for which recovery assistance is requested.

5. Where the initial instrument referred to in paragraph 2 or the global instrument referred to in paragraph 3 contains several claims, the applicant authority may list those claims in different uniform instruments permitting enforcement in the requested State, in line with the tax type related division of competences of the respective recovery offices in the requested State.

6. If a request cannot be transmitted by CCN network and is transmitted by post, the uniform instrument permitting enforcement in the requested State shall be signed by a duly authorised official of the applicant authority.

### Article 3.3: Conversion of the sums to be recovered
1. The applicant authority shall express the amount of the claim to be recovered in the currency of the applicant State and in the currency of the requested State.

2. For requests sent to the United Kingdom, the exchange rate to be used for the purposes of the recovery assistance shall be the exchange rate published by the European Central Bank on the day before the date on which the request is sent. Where there is no such rate available on that date, the exchange rate used shall be the latest exchange rate published by the European Central Bank before the date the request is sent.
For requests sent to a Member State, the exchange rate to be used for the purposes of the recovery assistance shall be the exchange rate published by the Bank of England on the day before the date on which the request is sent. Where there is no such rate available on that date, the exchange rate used shall be the latest exchange rate published by the Bank of England before the date the request is sent.

3. In order to convert the amount of the claim resulting from the adjustment, referred to in paragraph 2 of Article 30 of the Protocol, into the currency of the State of the requested authority, the applicant authority shall use the exchange rate used in its initial request.

### Article 3.4: Transfer of recovered amounts
1. The transfer of the recovered amounts shall take place within two months of the date on which recovery was effected, unless otherwise agreed between the States.

2. However, if recovery measures applied by the requested authority are contested for a reason not falling within the responsibility of the applicant State, the requested authority may wait to transfer any sums recovered in relation to the applicant State’s claim, until the dispute is settled, if the following conditions are simultaneously fulfilled:
    (a) the requested authority finds it likely that the outcome of this contestation will be favourable to the party concerned; and
    (b) the applicant authority has not declared that it will reimburse the sums already transferred if the outcome of that contestation is favourable to the party concerned.

3. If the applicant authority has made a declaration to reimburse in accordance with point (b) of the second paragraph, it shall return the recovered amounts already transferred by the requested

_This document has been agreed between the European Union and the United Kingdom and is provided for information only.
No rights may be derived from it until the date of application. The numbering of the articles is provisional._

authority within one month of the receipt of the request for reimbursement. Any other compensation due shall, in that case, be borne solely by the requested authority.

### Article 3.5: Reimbursement of recovered amounts
The requested authority shall notify any action taken in the requested State for reimbursement of sums recovered or for compensation in relation to recovery of contested claims to the applicant authority immediately after the requested authority has been informed of such action.
The requested authority shall as far as possible involve the applicant authority in the procedures for settling the amount to be reimbursed and the compensation due. Upon receipt of a reasoned request from the requested authority, the applicant authority shall transfer the sums reimbursed and the compensation paid within two months of the receipt of that request.

### Article 3.6: Standard forms
