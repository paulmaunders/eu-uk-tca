Article 1: Objective
 
The objective of this Annex is to lay down the necessary procedural and technical provisions for the
implementation of Title IX [Exchange of criminal record information] of Part Three.

 
Article 2: Communications network
 
1. The electronic exchange of information extracted from the criminal record between, on the
one side, a Member State and, on the other side, the United Kingdom shall take place using a
common communication infrastructure that provides for encrypted communications.
2. The common communication infrastructure shall be the Trans European Services for
Telematics between Administrations (TESTA) communications network. Any further developments
thereof or any alternative secure network shall ensure that the common communication
infrastructure in place continues to fulfil the security requirements adequate for the exchange of
criminal record information.

 
Article 3: Interconnection software
 
1. The States shall use a standardised interconnection software enabling the connection of
their central authorities to the common communication infrastructure in order to exchange the
information extracted from the criminal record with the other States electronically in accordance
with the provisions of Title IX [Exchange of criminal record information] of Part Three and this
Annex.
2. For the Member States, the interconnection software shall be the ECRIS reference
implementation software or their national ECRIS implementation software, if necessary adapted for
the purposes of information exchange with the United Kingdom as set out in this Agreement.
3. The United Kingdom shall be responsible for the development and operation of its own
interconnection software. For that purpose, at the latest before the entry into force of this
Agreement, the United Kingdom shall ensure that its national interconnection software functions in
accordance with the protocols and technical specifications established for the ECRIS reference
implementation software, and with any further technical requirements established by eu-LISA.
4. The United Kingdom shall also ensure the implementation of any subsequent technical
adaptations to its national interconnection software required by any changes to the technical
specifications established for the ECRIS reference implementation software, or changes to any
further technical requirements established by eu-LISA, without undue delay. To that end, the Union
shall ensure that the United Kingdom is informed without undue delay of any planned changes to
the technical specifications or requirements and is provided with any information necessary for the
United Kingdom to comply with its obligations under this Annex.
