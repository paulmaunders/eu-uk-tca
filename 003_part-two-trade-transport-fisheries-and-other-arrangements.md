5. The temporary suspension shall apply only for the period necessary to counteract the breaches or circumventions and to protect the financial interests of the Party concerned, and in any case not for longer than six months. The Party concerned shall keep the situation under review and, where it decides that the temporary suspension is no longer necessary, it shall bring it to an end before the end of the period notified to the Trade Partnership Committee. Where the conditions that gave rise to the suspension persist at the expiry of the period notified to the Trade Partnership Committee, the Party concerned may decide to renew the suspension. Any suspension shall be subject to periodic consultations within the Trade Partnership Committee.

6. Each Party shall publish, in accordance with its internal procedures, notices to importers about any decision concerning temporary suspensions referred to in paragraphs 4 and 5.

In case of systematic errors by the competent authorities or issues concerning the proper management of the preferential system at export, concerning notably the application of the provisions of Chapter 2 of this Title or the application of the Protocol on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Customs Matters, and if these errors or issues lead to consequences in terms of import duties, the Party facing such consequences may request the Trade Partnership Committee to examine the possibility of adopting decisions, as appropriate, to resolve the situation.

##### Article GOODS.21: Cultural property
1. The Parties shall cooperate in facilitating the return of cultural property illicitly removed from the territory of a Party, having regard to the principles enshrined in the UNESCO Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property signed in Paris on 17 November 1970.

The customs authority of the importing Party may request the importer for specific documentation and information, if appropriate.

6. If the customs authority of the importing Party decides to suspend the granting of preferential tariff treatment to the product concerned while awaiting the results of the verification, the release of the products shall be offered to the importer subject to appropriate precautionary measures including guarantees.

3. If the customs authority of the importing Party has sufficient justification to deny preferential tariff treatment under paragraph 1 of this Article, in cases where the customs authority of the exporting Party has provided an opinion pursuant to point (b) of Article ORIG.25(4) [Administrative cooperation] confirming the originating status of the products, the customs authority of the importing Party shall notify the customs authority of the exporting Party of its intention to deny the preferential tariff treatment within two months after the date of receipt of that opinion.

6. The importing Party shall not put in place any additional administrative system or procedure that unnecessarily hampers trade.

##### Article SPS.6: Official certification
1. Where the importing Party requires official certificates, the model certificates shall be:
    (a) set in line with the principles as laid down in the international standards of the Codex, the IPPC and the OIE; and
    (b) applicable to imports from all parts of the territory of the exporting Party.

2. The Trade Specialised Committee on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures may agree on specific cases where the model certificates referred to in paragraph 1 would be established only for a part or parts of the territory of the exporting Party. The Parties shall promote the implementation of electronic certification and other technologies to facilitate trade.

##### Article SPS.7: Import conditions and procedures
1. Without prejudice to the rights and obligations each Party has under the SPS Agreement and this Chapter, the import conditions of the importing Party shall apply to the entire territory of the exporting Party in a consistent manner.

2. The exporting Party shall ensure that products exported to the other Party, such as animals and animal products, plants and plant products, or other related objects, meet the SPS requirements of the importing Party.

3. The importing Party may require that imports of particular products are subject to authorisation. Such authorisation shall be granted where a request is made by the relevant competent authority of the exporting Party which objectively demonstrates, to the satisfaction of the importing Party, that the authorisation requirements of the importing Party are fulfilled. The relevant competent authority of the exporting Party may make a request for authorisation in respect of the entire territory of the exporting Party. The importing Party shall grant such requests on that basis, where they fulfil the authorisation requirements of the importing Party as set out in this paragraph.

4. The importing Party shall not introduce authorisation requirements which are additional to those which apply at the end of the transition period, unless the application of such requirements to further products is justified to mitigate a significant risk to human, animal or plant health.

5. The importing Party shall establish and communicate to the other Party import conditions for all products. The importing Party shall ensure that its import conditions are applied in a proportionate and non-discriminatory manner.

6. Without prejudice to provisional measures under Article 5(7) of the SPS Agreement, for products, or other related objects, where a phytosanitary concern exists, the import conditions shall be restricted to measures to protect against regulated pests of the importing Party and shall be applicable to the entire territory of the exporting Party.

7. Notwithstanding paragraphs 1 and 3, in the case of import authorisation requests for a specific product, where the exporting Party has requested to be examined only for a part, or certain parts, of its territory (in the case of the Union, individual Member States), the importing Party shall promptly proceed to the examination of that request. Where the importing Party receives requests in respect of the specific product from more than one part of the exporting Party, or, where further requests are received in respect of a product which has already been authorised, the importing Party shall expedite completion of the authorisation procedure, taking into account the identical or similar SPS regime applicable in the different parts of the exporting Party.

8. Each Party shall ensure that all SPS control, inspection and approval procedures are initiated and completed without undue delay. Information requirements shall be limited to what is necessary for the approval process to take into account information already available in the importing Party, such as on the legislative framework and audit reports of the exporting Party.

9. Except in duly justified circumstances related to its level of protection, each Party shall provide a transition period between the publication of any changes to its approval procedures and their application to allow the other Party to become familiar with and adapt to such changes. Each Party shall not unduly prolong the approval process for applications submitted prior to publication of the changes.

10. In relation to the processes set out in paragraphs 3 to 8, the following actions shall be taken:
    (a) as soon as the importing Party has positively concluded its assessment, it shall promptly take all necessary legislative and administrative measures to allow trade to take place without undue delay;
    (b) the exporting Party shall:
        (i) provide all relevant information required by the importing Party; and
        (ii) give reasonable access to the importing Party for audit and other relevant procedures.
    (c.) the importing party shall establish a list of regulated pests for products, or other related objects, where a phytosanitary concern exists. That list shall contain:
        (i) the pests not known to occur within any part of its own territory;
        (ii) the pests known to occur within its own territory and under official control;
        (iii) the pests known to occur within parts of its own territory and for which pest free areas or protected zones are established; and
        (iv) non-quarantine pests known to occur within its own territory and under official control for specified planting material.

11. The importing Party shall accept consignments without requiring that the importing Party verifies compliance of those consignments before their departure from the territory of the exporting Party.

12. A Party may collect fees for the costs incurred to conduct specific SPS frontier checks, which should not exceed the recovery of the costs.

13. The importing Party shall have the right to carry out import checks on products imported from the exporting Party for the purposes of ensuring compliance with its SPS import requirements.

14. The import checks carried out on products imported from the exporting Party shall be based on the SPS risk associated with such importations. Import checks shall be carried out only to the extent necessary to protect human, animal or plant life and health, without undue delay and with a minimum effect on trade between the Parties.

15. Information on the proportion of products from the exporting Party checked at import shall be made available by the importing Party upon request of the exporting Party.

16. If import checks reveal non-compliance with the relevant import conditions the action taken by the importing Party must be based on an assessment of the risk involved and not be more trade restrictive than required to achieve the Party's appropriate level of SPS protection.

##### Article SPS.8 Lists of approved establishments
1. Whenever justified, the importing Party may maintain a list of approved establishments meeting its import requirements as a condition to allow imports of animal products from these establishments.

2. Unless justified to mitigate a significant risk to human or animal health, lists of approved establishments shall only be required for the products for which they were required at the end of the transition period.

3. The exporting Party shall inform the importing Party of its list of establishments meeting the importing Party’s conditions which shall be based on guarantees provided by the exporting Party.

4. Upon a request from the exporting Party, the importing Party shall approve establishments which are situated in the territory of the exporting Party, based on guarantees provided by the exporting Party, without prior inspection of individual establishments.

5. Unless the importing Party requests additional information and subject to guarantees being provided by the exporting party, the importing Party shall take the necessary legislative or administrative measures, in accordance with its applicable legal procedures, to allow imports from those establishments without undue delay.

6. The list of the approved establishments shall be made publicly available by the importing Party.

7. Where the importing Party decides to reject the request of the exporting Party to accept adding an establishment to the list of approved establishments, it shall inform the exporting Party without delay and shall submit a reply, including information about the non-conformities which led to the rejection of the establishment’s approval.

##### Article SPS.9: Transparency and exchange of information
1. Each Party shall pursue transparency as regards SPS measures applicable to trade and shall for those purposes undertake the following actions:
    (a) promptly communicate to the other Party any changes to its SPS measures and approval procedures, including changes that may affect its capacity to fulfil the SPS import requirements of the other Party for certain products;
    (b) enhance mutual understanding of its SPS measures and their application;
    (c) exchange information with the other Party on matters related to the development and application of SPS measures, including the progress on new available scientific evidence, that affect, or may affect, trade between the Parties with a view to minimising negative trade effects;
    (d) upon request of the other Party, communicate the conditions that apply for the import of specific products within 20 working days;
    (e) upon request of the other Party, communicate the state of play of the procedure for the authorisation of specific products within 20 working days;

4. International standards developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and Codex Alimentarius Commission (Codex) shall be the relevant international standards within the meaning of Article 2, Article 5 and Annex 3 of the TBT Agreement.

5. A standard developed by other international organisations, could also be considered a relevant international standard within the meaning of Article 2, 
Article 5 and Annex 3 of the TBT Agreement, provided that:
    (a) it has been developed by a standardising body which seeks to establish consensus either:
        (i) among national delegations of the participating WTO Members representing all the national standardising bodies in their territory that have adopted, or expect to adopt, standards for the subject matter to which the international standardisation activity relates, or,
        (ii) among governmental bodies of participating WTO Members, and,
    (b) it has been developed in accordance with the Decision of the WTO Committee on Technical Barriers to Trade on Principles for the Development of International Standards, Guides and Recommendations with relation to Articles 2, 5, and Annex 3 of the TBT Agreement.4

6. Where a Party does not use international standards as a basis for a technical regulation, on request of the other Party, it shall identify any substantial deviation from the relevant international standard, explain the reasons why such standards were judged inappropriate or ineffective for the objective pursued, and provide the scientific or technical evidence on which that assessment was based.

7. Each Party shall review its technical regulations to increase the convergence of those technical regulations with relevant international standards, taking into account, inter alia, any new developments in the relevant international standards or any changes in the circumstances that have given rise to divergence from any relevant international standards.

8. In accordance with its respective rules and procedures and without prejudice to Title X [Good Regulatory Practices and Regulatory Cooperation], when developing a major technical regulation which may have a significant effect on trade, each Party shall ensure that procedures exist that allow persons to express their opinion in a public consultation, except where urgent problems of safety, health, environment or national security arise or threaten to arise. Each Party shall allow persons of the other Party to participate in such consultations on terms that are no less favourable than those accorded to its own nationals, and shall make the results of those consultations public.

##### Article TBT.5: Standards
1. Each Party shall encourage the standardising bodies established within its territory, as well as the regional standardising bodies of which a Party or the standardising bodies established in its territory are members:
    (a) to participate, within the limits of their resources, in the preparation of international standards by relevant international standardising bodies;
    (b) to use relevant international standards as a basis for the standards they develop, except where such international standards would be ineffective or inappropriate, for example because of an insufficient level of protection, fundamental climatic or geographical factors or fundamental technological problems;
[^4] G/TBT/9, 13 November 2000, Annex 4.
    (c.) to avoid duplications of, or overlaps with, the work of international standardising bodies;
    (d) to review national and regional standards that are not based on relevant international standards at regular intervals, with a view to increasing the convergence of those standards with relevant international standards;
    (e) to cooperate with the relevant standardising bodies of the other Party in international standardisation activities, including through cooperation in the international standardising bodies or at regional level;

##### Article TBT.6: Conformity assessment
1. Article TBT.4 [Technical regulations] concerning the preparation, adoption and application of technical regulations shall also apply to conformity assessment procedures, mutatis mutandis.

2. Where a Party requires conformity assessment as a positive assurance that a product conforms with a technical regulation, it shall:
    (a) select conformity assessment procedures that are proportionate to the risks involved, as determined on the basis of a risk-assessment;
    (b) consider as proof of compliance with technical regulations the use of a supplier’s declaration of conformity, i.e. a declaration of conformity issued by the manufacturer on the sole responsibility of the manufacturer without a mandatory third-party assessment, as assurance of conformity among the options for showing compliance with technical regulations;
    (c) where requested by the other Party, provide information on the criteria used to select the conformity assessment procedures for specific products.

3. Where a Party requires third party conformity assessment as a positive assurance that a product conforms with a technical regulation and it has not reserved this task to a government authority as specified in paragraph 4, it shall:
    (a) use accreditation, as appropriate, as a means to demonstrate technical competence to qualify conformity assessment bodies. Without prejudice to its right to establish requirements for conformity assessment bodies, each Party recognises the valuable role that accreditation operated with authority derived from government and on a non-commercial basis can play in the qualification of conformity assessment bodies;
    (b) use relevant international standards for accreditation and conformity assessment;
    (c.) encourage accreditation bodies and conformity assessment bodies located within its territory to join any relevant functioning international agreements or arrangements for harmonisation or facilitation of acceptance of conformity assessment results;
    (d) if two or more conformity assessment bodies are authorised by a Party to carry out conformity assessment procedures required for placing a product on the market, ensure that economic operators have a choice amongst the conformity assessment bodies designated by the authorities of a Party for a particular product or set of products;
    (e) ensure that conformity assessment bodies are independent of manufacturers, importers and economic operators in general and that there are no conflicts of interest between accreditation bodies and conformity assessment bodies; 
    (f) allow conformity assessment bodies to use subcontractors to perform testing or inspections in relation to the conformity assessment, including subcontractors located in the territory of the other Party, and may require subcontractors to meet the same requirements the conformity assessment body must meet to perform such testing or inspections itself; and

2. Articles SERVIN.2.2 [Market access], SERVIN.2.3 [National treatment], SERVIN.2.4 [Most favoured nation treatment], SERVIN.2.5 [Senior management and boards of directors] and SERVIN.2.6 [Performance requirements] do not apply to a measure of a Party which is consistent with the reservations, conditions or qualifications specified with respect to a sector, subsector or activity listed in Annex SERVIN.2 [Future measures].

3. Articles SERVIN.2.3 [National treatment] and SERVIN.2.4 [Most favoured nation treatment] do not apply to any measure that constitutes an exception to, or a derogation from, Articles 3 or 4 of the TRIPS Agreement, as specifically provided for in Articles 3 to 5 of that Agreement.

4. For greater certainty, Articles SERVIN.2.3 [National treatment] and SERVIN.2.4 [Most favoured nation treatment] shall not be construed as preventing a Party from prescribing information requirements, including for statistical purposes, in connection with the establishment or operation of investors of the other Party or of covered enterprises, provided that it does not constitute a means to circumvent that Party’s obligations under those Articles.

### Chapter 3: Cross-border trade in services
##### Article SERVIN.3.1: Scope
This Chapter applies to measures of a Party affecting the cross-border trade in services by service suppliers of the other Party.

##### Article SERVIN.3.2: Market access
A Party shall not adopt or maintain, either on the basis of its entire territory or on the basis of a territorial sub-division, measures that:
    (a) impose limitations on:
        (i) the number of services suppliers that may supply a specific service, whether in the form of numerical quotas, monopolies, exclusive service suppliers or the requirement of an economic needs test;
        (ii) the total value of service transactions or assets in the form of numerical quotas or the requirement of an economic needs test; or
        (iii) the total number of service operations or on the total quantity of service output expressed in the terms of designated numerical units in the form of quotas or the requirement of an economic needs test13; or
    (b) restrict or require specific types of legal entity or joint venture through which a service supplier may supply a service.

##### Article SERVIN.3.3: Local presence
A Party shall not require a service supplier of the other Party to establish or maintain an enterprise or to be resident in its territory as a condition for the cross-border supply of a service.

##### Article SERVIN.3.4: National treatment
1. Each Party shall accord to services and service suppliers of the other Party treatment no less favourable than that it accords, in like situations, to its own services and services suppliers.

2. A Party may meet the requirement of paragraph 1 by according to services and service suppliers of the other Party either formally identical treatment or formally different treatment to that it accords to its own services and service suppliers.
[^13]    Point (a) (iii) of Article SERVIN.3.2 [Market access] does not cover measures by a Party which limit inputs for the supply of services.

3. Formally identical or formally different treatment shall be considered to be less favourable if it modifies the conditions of competition in favour of services or service suppliers of the Party compared to services or service suppliers of the other Party.

4. Nothing in this Article shall be construed as requiring either Party to compensate for inherent competitive disadvantages which result from the foreign character of the relevant services or services suppliers. 

##### Article SERVIN.3.5: Most favoured nation treatment
1. Each Party shall accord to services and service suppliers of the other Party treatment no less favourable than that it accords, in like situations, to services and service suppliers of a third country.

2. Paragraph 1 shall not be construed as obliging a Party to extend to services and service suppliers of the other Party the benefit of any treatment resulting from:
    (a) an international agreement for the avoidance of double taxation or other international agreement or arrangement relating wholly or mainly to taxation; or
    (b) measures providing for recognition, including of the standards or criteria for the authorisation, licencing, or certification of a natural person or enterprise to carry out an economic activity, or of prudential measures as referred to in paragraph 3 of the GATS Annex on Financial Services.

3. For greater certainty, the existence of substantive provisions in other international agreements concluded by a Party with a third country, or mere formal transposition of those provisions into domestic law to the extent that it is necessary in order to incorporate them into the domestic legal order, do not in themselves constitute the "treatment" referred to in paragraph 1. Measures of a Party pursuant to those provisions may constitute such treatment and thus give rise to a breach of this Article.

##### Article SERVIN.3.6: Non-conforming measures
1. Articles SERVIN.3.2 [Market access], SERVIN.3.3 [Local presence], SERVIN.3.4 [National treatment] and SERVIN.3.5 [Most favoured nation treatment] do not apply to:

    (c.) a modification of any non-conforming measure referred to in points (a) and (b) of this paragraph to the extent that it does not decrease the conformity of the measure, as it existed immediately before the modification, with Articles SERVIN.3.2 [Market access], SERVIN.3.3 [Local presence]], SERVIN.3.4 [National treatment] and SERVIN.3.5 [Most favoured nation treatment].

2. Articles 3.2 [Market access], SERVIN.3.3 [Local presence], SERVIN.3.4 [National treatment] and SERVIN.3.5 [Most favoured nation treatment] do not apply to any measure of a Party which is consistent with the reservations, conditions or qualifications specified with respect to a sector, subsector or activity listed in Annex SERVIN-2 [Future measures].

    (g) "trainee employee" means a natural person possessing a university degree who is temporarily transferred for career development purposes or to obtain training in business techniques or methods and is paid during the period of the transfer.18

6. The service contract referred to under points (b) and (c) of paragraph 5 shall comply with the requirements of the law of the Party where the contract is executed.
[^16]    Managers and specialists may be required to demonstrate they possess the professional qualifications and experience needed in the legal person to which they are transferred.
[^17]    While managers do not directly perform tasks concerning the actual supply of the services, this does not prevent them, in the course of executing their duties as described above, from performing such tasks as may be necessary for the provision of the services.
[^18] The recipient enterprise may be required to submit a training programme covering the duration of the stay for prior approval, demonstrating that the purpose of the stay is for training.

As far as measures relating to technical standards are concerned, this Section only applies to measures that affect trade in services. For the purposes of this Section, the term ‘technical standards’ does not include regulatory or implementing technical standards for financial services.

2. This Section does not apply to licensing requirements and procedures, qualification requirements and procedures, formalities and technical standards pursuant to a measure:
    (a) that does not conform with Article SERVIN.2.2 [Market access] or 2.3 [National treatment] and is referred to in points (a) to (c.) of Article SERVIN.2.7(1) [Non-conforming measures and exceptions] or with Article SERVIN.3.2 [Market access], Article SERVIN.3.3 [Local presence] or Article SERVIN.3.4 [National treatment] and is referred to in points (a) to (c.) of Article SERVIN.3.6(1) [Non-conforming measures] or with points (b) and (c.) of Article SERVIN 4.2(1) [Intra-corporate transferees and business visitors for establishment purposes], or Article SERVIN 4.3(3) [Short-term business visitors]] or with points (b) and (c.) of Article SERVIN 4.4(1) [Contractual service suppliers and independent professionals] and is referred to in Article SERVIN 4.5(1) [Non-conforming measures]; or

    (b) "competent authority" means a central, regional or local government or authority or non-governmental body in the exercise of powers delegated by central, regional or local governments or authorities, which is entitled to take a decision concerning the authorisation referred to in point (a).

##### Article SERVIN.5.2: Submission of applications
Each Party shall, to the extent practicable, avoid requiring an applicant to approach more than one competent authority for each application for authorisation. If an activity for which authorisation is requested is within the jurisdiction of multiple competent authorities, multiple applications for authorisation may be required.

##### Article SERVIN.5.3: Application timeframes
If a Party requires authorisation, it shall ensure that its competent authorities, to the extent practicable, permit the submission of an application at any time throughout the year. If a specific time period for applying for authorisation exists, the Party shall ensure that the competent authorities allow a reasonable period of time for the submission of an application.

##### Article SERVIN.5.4: Electronic applications and acceptance of copies
If a Party requires authorisation, it shall ensure that its competent authorities:
    (a) to the extent possible provide for applications to be completed by electronic means, including from within the territory of the other Party; and
    (b) accept copies of documents, that are authenticated in accordance with the Party’s domestic law, in place of original documents, unless the competent authorities require original documents to protect the integrity of the authorisation process.

##### Article SERVIN.5.5: Processing of applications
1. If a Party requires authorisation, it shall ensure that its competent authorities:
    (a) process applications throughout the year. Where that is not possible, this information should be made public in advance, to the extent feasible;
    (b) to the extent practicable, provide an indicative timeframe for the processing of an application. That timeframe shall be reasonable to the extent practicable;
    (c.) at the request of the applicant, provide without undue delay information concerning the status of the application;
    (d) to the extent practicable, ascertain without undue delay the completeness of an application for processing under the Party’s domestic laws and regulations;
    (e) if they consider an application complete for the purposes of processing under the Party’s domestic laws and regulations,19 within a reasonable period of time after the submission of the application ensure that:
        (i) the processing of the application is completed; and
        (ii) the applicant is informed of the decision concerning the application, to the extent possible, in writing; [^20]
    (f) if they consider an application incomplete for the purposes of processing under the Party’s domestic laws and regulations, within a reasonable period of time, to the extent practicable:
        (i) inform the applicant that the application is incomplete;
        (ii) at the request of the applicant identify the additional information required to complete the application or otherwise provide guidance on why the application is considered incomplete; and
        (iii) provide the applicant with the opportunity to provide the additional information that is required to complete the application; [^21]
    however, if none of the above is practicable, and the application is rejected due to incompleteness, competent authorities shall ensure that they inform the applicant within a reasonable period of time; and
    (g) if an application is rejected, either upon their own initiative or upon request of the applicant, inform the applicant of the reasons for rejection and of the timeframe for an appeal against that decision and, if applicable, the procedures for resubmission of an application; an applicant shall not be prevented from submitting another application solely on the basis of a previously rejected application.

2. The Parties shall ensure that their competent authorities grant an authorisation as soon as it is established, on the basis of an appropriate examination, that the applicant meets the conditions for obtaining it.

3. The Parties shall ensure that, once granted, an authorisation enters into effect without undue delay, subject to the applicable terms and conditions. [^22]
4. 
[^19]   Balancing resource constraints against the potential burden on businesses, in cases where it is reasonable to do so, competent authorities may require that all information is submitted in a specified format to consider it "complete for the purposes of processing".
[^20]   Competent authorities may meet the requirement set out in point (ii) by informing an applicant in advance in writing, including through a published measure, that a lack of response after a specified period of time from the date of submission of the application indicates acceptance of the application. The reference to "in writing" should be understood as including electronic format.
[^21]   Such “opportunity” does not require a competent authority to provide extensions of deadlines.
[^22]   Competent authorities are not responsible for delays due to reasons outside their competence.

##### Article SERVIN.5.6: Fees
1. For all economic activities other than financial services, each Party shall ensure that the authorisation fees charged by its competent authorities are reasonable and transparent and do not in themselves restrict the supply of the relevant service or the pursuit of any other economic activity. Having regard to the cost and administrative burden, each Party is encouraged to accept payment of authorisation fees by electronic means.

2. With regard to financial services, each Party shall ensure that its competent authorities, with respect to authorisation fees that they charge, provide applicants with a schedule of fees or information on how fee amounts are determined, and do not use the fees as a means of avoiding the Party’s commitments or obligations.

    (a) clear and unambiguous;
    (b) objective and transparent;
    (c.) pre-established;
    (d) made public in advance;

##### Article SERVIN.5.11: Limited numbers of licences
If the number of licences available for a given activity is limited because of the scarcity of available natural resources or technical capacity, a Party shall apply a selection procedure to potential candidates which provides full guarantees of impartiality, objectivity and transparency, including, in particular, adequate publicity about the launch, conduct and completion of the procedure.

For the purposes of this Section, "administrative decisions" means a decision or action with a legal effect that applies to a specific person, good or service in an individual case and covers the failure to take an administrative decision or take such action when that is so required by a Party’s law. If such procedures are not independent of the competent authority entrusted with the administrative decision concerned, a Party shall ensure that the procedures in fact provide for an objective and impartial review.

##### Article SERVIN.5.13: Professional qualifications
1. Nothing in this Article shall prevent a Party from requiring that natural persons possess the necessary professional qualifications specified in the territory where the activity is performed, for the sector of activity concerned23.

2. The professional bodies or authorities, which are relevant for the sector of activity concerned in their respective territories, may develop and provide joint recommendations on the recognition of professional qualifications to the Partnership Council. Such joint recommendations shall be supported by an evidence-based assessment of:
    (a) the economic value of an envisaged arrangement on the recognition of professional qualifications; and
    (b) the compatibility of the respective regimes, that is, the extent to which the requirements applied by each Party for the authorisation, licensing, operation and certification are compatible.

3. On receipt of a joint recommendation, the Partnership Council shall review its consistency with this Title within a reasonable period of time. The Partnership Council may, following such review, develop and adopt an arrangement on the conditions for the recognition of professional qualifications by decision as an annex to this Agreement, which shall be considered to form an integral part of this Title. [^24]
[^23]   For greater certainty, this Article shall not be construed to prevent the negotiation and conclusion of one or more agreements between the Parties on the recognition of professional qualifications on conditions and requirements different from those provided for in this Article.
[^24]   For greater certainty, such arrangements shall not lead to the automatic recognition of qualifications but shall set, in the mutual interest of both Parties, the conditions for the competent authorities granting recognition.

4. An arrangement referred to under paragraph 3 shall provide for the conditions for recognition of professional qualifications acquired in the Union and professional qualifications acquired in the United Kingdom relating to an activity covered by this Title and Title III [Digital Trade] of Heading One.

5. The Guidelines for arrangements on the recognition of professional qualifications set out in Annex SERVIN-6 [Guidelines for arrangements on the recognition of professional qualifications] shall be taken into account in the development of the joint recommendations referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article and by the Partnership Council when assessing whether to adopt such an Arrangement, as referred to in paragraph 3 of this Article.

2. The proprietor of a registered trade mark shall be entitled to prevent all third parties from bringing goods, in the course of trade, into the Party where the trade mark is registered without being released for free circulation there, where such goods, including packaging, come from other countries or the other Party and bear without authorisation a trade mark which is identical to the trade mark registered in respect of such goods, or which cannot be distinguished in its essential aspects from that trade mark.

3. The entitlement of the proprietor of a trade mark pursuant to paragraph 2 shall lapse if during the proceedings to determine whether the registered trade mark has been infringed, evidence is provided by the declarant or the holder of the goods that the proprietor of the registered trade mark is not entitled to prohibit the placing of the goods on the market in the country of final destination.

2. The trade mark shall not entitle the proprietor to prohibit a third party from using, in the course of trade:
    (a) the name or address of the third party, where the third party is a natural person;
    (b) signs or indications concerning the kind, quality, quantity, intended purpose, value, geographical origin, the time of production of goods or of rendering of the service, or other characteristics of goods or services; or
    (c.) the trade mark for the purpose of identifying or referring to goods or services as those of the proprietor of that trade mark, in particular where the use of that trade mark is necessary to indicate the intended purpose of a product or service, in particular as accessories or spare parts,
provided the third party uses them in accordance with honest practices in industrial or commercial matters.

3. The trade mark shall not entitle the proprietor to prohibit a third party from using, in the course of trade, an earlier right which only applies in a particular locality if that right is recognised by the laws of the Party in question and is used within the limits of the territory in which it is recognised.

##### Article IP.24: Grounds for revocation
1. Each Party shall provide that a trade mark shall be liable to revocation if, within a continuous period of five years it has not been put to genuine use in the relevant territory of a Party by the proprietor or with the proprietor’s consent in relation to the goods or services for which it is registered, and there are no proper reasons for non-use.

2. Each Party shall also provide that a trade mark shall be liable to revocation if within the period of five years following the date of completion of the registration procedure it has not been put to genuine use in the relevant territory by the proprietor or with the proprietor’s consent, in relation to the goods or services for which it is registered, and there are no proper reasons for non-use.

3. However, no person may claim that the proprietor's rights in a trade mark should be revoked where, during the interval between expiry of the five-year period and filing of the application for revocation, genuine use of the trade mark has been started or resumed. The commencement or resumption of use within a period of three months preceding the filing of the application for revocation which began at the earliest on expiry of the continuous period of five years of non-use, shall, however, be disregarded where preparations for the commencement or resumption occur only after the proprietor becomes aware that the application for revocation may be filed.

4. A trade mark shall also be liable to revocation if, after the date on which it was registered:
    (a) as a consequence of acts or inactivity of the proprietor, it has become the common name in the trade for a good or service in respect of which it is registered;
    (b) as a consequence of the use made of the trade mark by the proprietor of the trade mark or with the proprietor's consent in respect of the goods or services for which it is registered, it is liable to mislead the public, particularly as to the nature, quality or geographical origin of those goods or services.

##### Article IP.25: The right to prohibit preparatory acts in relation to the use of packaging or other means
Where the risk exists that the packaging, labels, tags, security or authenticity features or devices, or any other means to which the trade mark is affixed could be used in relation to goods or services and that use would constitute an infringement of the rights of the proprietor of the trade mark, the proprietor of that trade mark shall have the right to prohibit the following acts if carried out in the course of trade:
    (a) affixing a sign identical with, or similar to, the trade mark on packaging, labels, tags, security or authenticity features or devices, or any other means to which the mark may be affixed; or

The holder of a registered design shall have the right to prevent third parties not having the holder's consent at least from making, offering for sale, selling, importing, exporting, stocking the product bearing and embodying the protected design or using articles bearing or embodying the protected design where such acts are undertaken for commercial purposes.

3. A design applied to or incorporated in a product which constitutes a component part of a complex product shall only be considered to be new and original:
    (a) if the component part, once it has been incorporated into the complex product, remains visible during normal use of the latter; and
    (b) to the extent that those visible features of the component part fulfil in themselves the requirements as to novelty and originality.

4. For the purposes of point (a) of paragraph 3, "normal use" means use by the end user, excluding maintenance, servicing or repair work.

2. Protection shall not extend to designs solely dictated by technical or functional considerations. A design shall not subsist in features of appearance of a product which must necessarily be reproduced in their exact form and dimensions in order to permit the product in which the design is incorporated or to which it is applied to be mechanically connected to or placed in, around or against another product so that either product may perform its function.

3. By way of derogation from paragraph 2, a design shall, in accordance with the conditions set out in Article IP.27(1) [Protection of registered designs], subsist in a design, which has the purpose of allowing the multiple assembly or connection of mutually interchangeable products within a modular system.

##### Article IP.31: Relationship to copyright
Each Party shall ensure that designs, including unregistered designs, shall also be eligible for protection under the copyright law of that Party as from the date on which the design was created or fixed in any form.

The Parties recognise that the period that elapses between the filing of the application for a patent and the first authorisation to place the product on the market, as defined for that purpose by the relevant legislation, may shorten the period of effective protection under the patent.

2. Each Party shall provide for further protection, in accordance with its laws and regulations, for a product which is protected by a patent and which has been subject to an administrative authorisation procedure referred to in paragraph 1 to compensate the holder of a patent for the reduction of effective patent protection. The terms and conditions for the provision of such further protection, including its length, shall be determined in accordance with the laws and regulations of the Parties.

Each Party shall also ensure that the judicial authorities may issue an injunction against intermediaries whose services are used by a third party to infringe an intellectual property right.

##### Article IP.46: Alternative measures
Each Party may provide that the judicial authorities, in appropriate cases and at the request of the person liable to be subject to the measures provided for in Article IP.44 [Corrective measures] or Article IP.45 [Injunctions], may order pecuniary compensation to be paid to the injured party instead of applying the measures provided for in these two Articles if that person acted unintentionally and without negligence, if execution of the measures in question would cause the person disproportionate harm and if pecuniary compensation to the injured party appears reasonably satisfactory.

##### Article IP.47: Damages
1. Each Party shall ensure that its judicial authorities, on application of the injured party, order the infringer who knowingly engaged, or had reasonable grounds to know it was engaging, in an infringing activity, to pay to the rightholder damages appropriate to the actual prejudice suffered by the rightholder as a result of the infringement.

2. Each Party shall ensure that when its judicial authorities set the damages:
    (a) they take into account all appropriate aspects, such as the negative economic consequences, including lost profits, which the injured party has suffered, any unfair profits made by the infringer and, in appropriate cases, elements other than economic factors, such as the moral prejudice caused to the right holder by the infringement; or
    (b) as an alternative to point (a), they may, in appropriate cases, set the damages as a lump sum on the basis of elements such as at least the amount of royalties or fees which would have been due if the infringer had requested authorisation to use the intellectual property right in question.

3. Where the infringer did not knowingly, or with reasonable grounds to know, engage in infringing activity, each Party may lay down that the judicial authorities may order the recovery of profits or the payment of damages which may be pre-established.

Such interim measures, provided for in subparagraph 7(a) of Article XVIII of the GPA, may result in suspension of the procurement process or, if a contract has been concluded by the procuring entity and if a Party has so provided, in suspension of performance of the contract. The procedures may provide that overriding adverse consequences for the interests concerned, including the public interest, may be taken into account when deciding whether such measures should be applied. Just cause for not acting shall be provided in writing.

3. In case an interested or participating supplier has submitted a challenge with the designated authority referred to in paragraph 1, each Party shall, in principle, ensure that a procuring entity shall not conclude the contract until that authority has made a decision or recommendation on the challenge with regard to interim measures, corrective action or compensation for the loss or damages suffered as referred to in paragraphs 2, 5 and 6 in accordance with its rules, regulations and procedures.

    (c.) to the extent possible and relevant, the potential social, economic and environmental impact of those options, including the impact on international trade and investment and, in accordance with its respective rules and procedures, the impact on small and medium-sized enterprises; and
    (d) where appropriate, how the options under consideration relate to relevant international standards, including the reasons for any divergence.

## TITLE XI: LEVEL PLAYING FIELD FOR OPEN AND FAIR COMPETITION AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
### Chapter one: General provisions
##### Article 1.1: Principles and objectives
1. The Parties recognise that trade and investment between the Union and the United Kingdom under the terms set out in this Agreement require conditions that ensure a level playing field for open and fair competition between the Parties and that ensure that trade and investment take place in a manner conducive to sustainable development.

3. Each Party reaffirms its ambition of achieving economy-wide climate neutrality by 2050.

4. The Parties affirm their common understanding that their economic relationship can only deliver benefits in a mutually satisfactory way if the commitments relating to a level playing field for open and fair competition stand the test of time, by preventing distortions of trade or investment, and by contributing to sustainable development. However the Parties recognise that the purpose of this Title is not to harmonise the standards of the Parties. The Parties are determined to maintain and improve their respective high standards in the areas covered by this Title.

##### Article 1.2: Right to regulate, precautionary approach^52 and scientific and technical information
1. The Parties affirm the right of each Party to set its policies and priorities in the areas covered by this Title, to determine the levels of protection it deems appropriate and to adopt or modify its law and policies in a manner consistent with each Party's international commitments, including its commitments under this Title.

2. The Parties acknowledge that, in accordance with the precautionary approach, where there are reasonable grounds for concern that there are potential threats of serious or irreversible damage to the environment or human health, the lack of full scientific certainty shall not be used as a reason for preventing a Party from adopting appropriate measures to prevent such damage.

3. When preparing or implementing measures aimed at protecting the environment or labour conditions that may affect trade or investment, each Party shall take into account relevant, available scientific and technical information, international standards, guidelines and recommendations.

##### Article 1.3 Dispute settlement
Title I [Dispute settlement] of Part Six [Dispute settlement and horizontal provisions] does not apply to this Chapter, except for Article 1.2(2) [Right to regulate, precautionary approach and scientific and technical information].

### Chapter two: Competition Policy
##### Article 2.1: Principles and definitions
1. The Parties recognise the importance of free and undistorted competition in their trade and investment relations. The Parties acknowledge that anticompetitive business practices may distort the proper functioning of markets and undermine the benefits of trade liberalisation.

2. For the purposes of this Chapter, an “economic actor” means an entity or a group of entities constituting a single economic entity, regardless of its legal status, that is engaged in an economic activity by offering goods or services on a market.
(^52) For greater certainty, in relation to the implementation of this Agreement in the territory of the Union, the precautionary approach refers to the precautionary principle.

##### Article 2.2: Competition law
1. In recognition of the principles set out in Article 2.1 [Principles and definitions], each Party shall maintain a competition law which effectively addresses the following anticompetitive business practices:
    a) agreements between economic actors, decisions by associations of economic actors and concerted practices which have as their object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition;
    b) abuse by one or more economic actors of a dominant position; and
    c.) for the United Kingdom, mergers or acquisitions and, for the Union, concentrations, between economic actors which may have significant anticompetitive effects.

2. The competition law referred to in paragraph 1 shall apply to all economic actors irrespective of their nationality or ownership status.

3. Each Party may provide for exemptions from its competition law in pursuit of legitimate public policy objectives, provided that those exemptions are transparent and are proportionate to those objectives.

##### Article 2.3: Enforcement
1. Each Party shall take appropriate measures to enforce its competition law in its territory.

2. Each Party shall maintain an operationally independent authority or authorities competent for the effective enforcement of its competition law.

3. Each Party shall apply its competition law in a transparent and non-discriminatory manner, respecting the principles of procedural fairness, including the rights of defence of the economic actors concerned, irrespective of their nationality or ownership status.

2. For the purposes of paragraph 1, the European Commission or the competition authorities of the Member States, on the one side, and the United Kingdom’s competition authority or authorities, on the other side, shall endeavour to cooperate and coordinate, with respect to their enforcement activities concerning the same or related conduct or transactions, where doing so is possible and appropriate.

3. To facilitate the cooperation and coordination referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2, the European Commission and the competition authorities of the Member States, on the one side, and the United Kingdom’s competition authority or authorities, on the other side, may exchange information to the extent permitted by each Party’s law.

4. To implement the objectives of this Article, the Parties may enter into a separate agreement on cooperation and coordination between the European Commission, the competition authorities of the Member States and the United Kingdom’s competition authority or authorities, which may include conditions for the exchange and use of confidential information.

##### Article 2.5: Dispute settlement
This Chapter shall not be subject to dispute settlement under Title I [Dispute settlement] of Part Six [Dispute settlement and horizontal provisions].

### Chapter three: Subsidy control
##### Article 3.1: Definitions
1. For the purposes of this Chapter:
    a) “economic actor” means an entity or a group of entities constituting a single economic entity, regardless of its legal status, that is engaged in an economic activity by offering goods or services on a market;
    b) “subsidy” means financial assistance which:
        (i) arises from the resources of the Parties, including:
            (A) a direct or contingent transfer of funds such as direct grants, loans or loan guarantees;
            (B) the forgoing of revenue that is otherwise due; or
            (C.) the provision of goods or services, or the purchase of goods or services;
        (ii) confers an economic advantage on one or more economic actors;
        (iii) is specific insofar as it benefits, as a matter of law or fact, certain economic actors over others in relation to the production of certain goods or services; and
        (iv) has, or could have, an effect on trade or investment between the Parties.

2. For the purposes of point (b)(iii) of paragraph 1:
    (a) a tax measure shall not be considered as specific unless:
        (i) certain economic actors obtain a reduction in the tax liability that they otherwise would have borne under the normal taxation regime; and
        (ii) those economic actors are treated more advantageously than others in a comparable position within the normal taxation regime; for the purposes of this point, a normal taxation regime is defined by its internal objective, by its features (such as the tax base, the taxable person, the taxable event or the tax rate) and by an authority which is autonomous institutionally, procedurally, economically and financially and has the competence to design the features of the taxation regime.
    (b) notwithstanding point (a), a subsidy shall not be regarded as specific if it is justified by principles inherent to the design of the general system. In the case of tax measures, examples of such inherent principles are the need to fight fraud or tax evasion, administrative manageability, the avoidance of double taxation, the principle of tax neutrality, the progressive nature of income tax and its redistributive purpose, or the need to respect taxpayers’ ability to pay;
    (c.) notwithstanding point (a), special purpose levies shall not be regarded as specific if their design is required by non-economic public policy objectives, such as the need to limit the negative impacts of certain activities or products on the environment or human health, insofar as the public policy objectives are not discriminatory^53.

##### Article 3.2: Scope and exceptions
1. Article 3.4 [Principles], 3.5 [Prohibited subsidies and subsidies subject to conditions] and Article 3.12 [Remedial measures] do not apply to subsidies granted to compensate the damage caused by natural disasters or other exceptional non-economic occurrences.

2. Nothing in this Chapter prevents the Parties from granting subsidies of a social character that are targeted at final consumers.

3. Subsidies that are granted on a temporary basis to respond to a national or global economic emergency shall be targeted, proportionate and effective in order to remedy that emergency. Articles 3.5 [Prohibited subsidies and subsidies subject to conditions] and 3.12 [Remedial measures] do not apply to such subsidies.

4. This Chapter does not apply to subsidies where the total amount granted to a single economic actor is below 325,000 Special Drawing Rights over any period of three fiscal years. The Partnership Council may amend that threshold.

5. This Chapter does not apply to subsidies that are subject to the provisions of Part IV or Annex 2 of the Agreement on Agriculture and subsidies related to trade in fish and fish products.

6. This Chapter does not apply to subsidies related to the audio-visual sector.

7. Article 3.9 [Independent authority or body and cooperation] does not apply to subsidies financed by resources of the Parties at supranational level.

8. For the purposes of subsidies to air carriers, for any reference to “effect on trade or investment between the Parties” in this Chapter, there shall be substituted a reference to “effect on competition between air carriers of the Parties in the provision of air transport services”, including those air transport services not covered under Title I [Air transport] of Heading 2 [Aviation].

##### Article 3.3: Services of public economic interest
1. Subsidies granted to economic actors assigned with particular tasks in the public interest, including public service obligations, are subject to Article 3.4 [Principles] insofar as the application of
(^53) For this purpose, discrimination means that there is less favourable treatment of an economic actor compared with others in like situations and that that differential treatment is not justified by objective criteria.

the principles set out in that Article does not obstruct the performance in law or fact of the particular task assigned to the economic actor concerned. The task shall be assigned in advance in a transparent manner.

2. The Parties shall ensure that the amount of compensation granted to an economic actor that is assigned with a task in the public interest is limited to what is necessary to cover all or part of the costs incurred in the discharge of that task, taking into account the relevant receipts and a reasonable profit for discharging that task. The Parties shall ensure that the compensation granted is not used to cross-subsidise activities falling outside the scope of the assigned task. Compensation below 15 million Special Drawing Rights per task shall not be subject to the obligations under Article 3.7 [Transparency]. The Partnership Council may amend this threshold.

3. This Chapter does not apply where the total compensation to an economic actor providing tasks in the public interest is below 750,000 Special Drawing Rights over any period of three fiscal years. The Partnership Council may amend this threshold.

##### Article 3.4: Principles
1. With a view to ensuring that subsidies are not granted where they have or could have a material effect on trade or investment between the Parties, each Party shall have in place and maintain an effective system of subsidy control that ensures that the granting of a subsidy respects the following principles:
    a) subsidies pursue a specific public policy objective to remedy an identified market failure or to address an equity rationale such as social difficulties or distributional concerns (“the objective”);
    b) subsidies are proportionate and limited to what is necessary to achieve the objective;
    c.) subsidies are designed to bring about a change of economic behaviour of the beneficiary that is conducive to achieving the objective and that would not be achieved in the absence of subsidies being provided;
    d) subsidies should not normally compensate for the costs the beneficiary would have funded in the absence of any subsidy;
    e) subsidies are an appropriate policy instrument to achieve a public policy objective and that objective cannot be achieved through other less distortive means;
    f) subsidies’ positive contributions to achieving the objective outweigh any negative effects, in particular the negative effects on trade or investment between the Parties.

2. Without prejudice to paragraph 1, each Party shall apply the conditions set out in Article 3.5 [Prohibited subsidies and subsidies subject to conditions], where relevant, if the subsidies concerned have or could have a material effect on trade or investment between the Parties.

3. It is for each Party to determine how its obligations under paragraphs 1 and 2 are implemented in the design of its subsidy control system in its own domestic law, provided that each Party shall ensure that the obligations in paragraphs 1 and 2 are implemented in its law in such a manner that the legality of an individual subsidy will be determined by the principles.

##### Article 3.5 Prohibited subsidies and subsidies subject to conditions
1. The categories of the subsidies referred to in Article 3.4(2) [Principles] and the conditions to be applied to them are as follows. The Partnership Council may update these provisions as necessary to ensure the operation of this Article over time.
__Unlimited state guarantees__

2. Subsidies in the form of a guarantee of debts or liabilities of an economic actor without any limitation as to the amount of those debts and liabilities or the duration of that guarantee shall be prohibited.
__Rescue and restructuring__

3. Subsidies for restructuring an ailing or insolvent economic actor without the economic actor having prepared a credible restructuring plan shall be prohibited. The restructuring plan shall be based on realistic assumptions with a view to ensuring the return to long-term viability of the ailing or insolvent economic actor within a reasonable time period. During the preparation of the restructuring plan, the economic actor can receive temporary liquidity support in the form of loans or loan guarantees. Except for small and medium-sized enterprises, an economic actor or its owners, creditors or new investors shall contribute significant funds or assets to the cost of restructuring. For the purposes of this paragraph, an ailing or insolvent economic actor is one that would almost certainly go out of business in the short to medium term without the subsidy

4. Other than in exceptional circumstances, subsidies for the rescue and restructuring of insolvent or ailing economic actors should only be allowed if they contribute to an objective of public interest by avoiding social hardship or preventing a severe market failure, in particular with regard to job losses or disruption of an important service that is difficult to replicate. Except in the case of unforeseeable circumstances not caused by the beneficiary, they should not be granted more than once in any five year period.

5. Paragraphs 3 and 4 do not apply to subsidies to ailing or insolvent banks, credit institutions and insurance companies.
__Banks, credit institutions and insurance companies__

6. Without prejudice to Article SERVIN 5.39 [Prudential carve-out], subsidies to restructure banks, credit institutions and insurance companies may only be granted on the basis of a credible restructuring plan that restores long-term viability. If a return to long-term viability cannot be credibly demonstrated, any subsidy to banks, credit institutions and insurance companies shall be limited to what is needed to ensure their orderly liquidation and exit from the market while minimising the amount of the subsidy and its negative effect on trade or investment between the Parties.

7. It shall be ensured that the granting authority is properly remunerated for the restructuring subsidy and that the beneficiary, its shareholders, its creditors or the business group to which the beneficiary belongs, contribute significantly to the restructuring or liquidation costs from their own resources. Subsidies to support liquidity provisions shall be temporary, shall not be used to absorb losses and shall not become capital support. Proper remuneration shall be paid to the granting authority for the subsidies granted to support liquidity provisions.

__Export subsidies__

8. Subsidies that are contingent in law or in fact^54, whether solely or as one of several other conditions, upon export performance relating to goods or services, shall be prohibited, except in relation to:
    (a) short-term credit insurance for non-marketable risks; or
    (b) export credits and export credit guarantee or insurance programmes that are permissible in accordance with the SCM Agreement, read with any adjustments necessary for context.

9. For the purposes of point (a) of paragraph 8 “marketable risk” means commercial and political risks with a maximum risk period of less than two years on public and non-public buyers in marketable risk countries55. A country may be understood to be temporarily removed from the group of marketable risk countries if there is a lack of sufficient private market capacity because of:
    (a) a significant contraction of private credit insurance capacity;
    (b) a significant deterioration of sovereign sector rating; or
    (c.) a significant deterioration of corporate sector performance.

10. Such temporary removal of a marketable risk country shall take effect, as far as a Party is concerned, in accordance with a decision of that Party on the basis of the criteria in paragraph 9, and only if that Party adopts such a decision. The publication of that decision shall be deemed to constitute notification to the other Party of such temporary removal as far as the former Party is concerned.

11. If a subsidised insurer provides export credit insurance, any insurance for marketable risks shall be provided on a commercial basis. In such a case, the insurer shall not directly or indirectly benefit from subsidies for the provision of insurance for marketable risks.
__Subsidies contingent upon the use of domestic content__

12. Without prejudice to Article SERVIN 2.6 [Performance requirements] and Article SERVIN 2.7 [Non-conforming measures and exceptions], subsidies contingent, whether solely or as one of several other conditions, upon the use of domestic over imported goods or services shall be prohibited.
__Large cross border or international cooperation projects__

13. Subsidies may be granted in the context of large cross border or international cooperation projects, such as those for transport, energy, the environment, research and development, and first deployment projects to incentivise the emergence and deployment of new technologies (excluding manufacturing). The benefits of such cross border or international cooperation projects must not be limited to the economic actors or to the sector or the States participating, but must have wider benefit and relevance through spill over effects that do not exclusively accrue to the State that grants the subsidy, the relevant sector and beneficiary.
(^54) For greater certainty, this standard is met when the facts demonstrate that the granting of a subsidy, without having been made legally contingent upon export performance, is in fact tied to actual or anticipated exportation or export earnings. The mere fact that a subsidy is granted to economic actors which export shall not for that reason alone be considered to be an export subsidy within the meaning of this provision.
(^55) The marketable risk countries are the United Kingdom, the Member States of the Union, Australia, Canada, Iceland, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, Switzerland, and the United States of America.


__Energy and environment__

14. The Parties recognise the importance of a secure, affordable and sustainable energy system and environmental sustainability, notably in relation to the fight against climate change which represent an existential threat to humanity. Therefore, without prejudice to Article 3.4 [Principles], the subsidies in relation to energy and environment shall be aimed at, and incentivise the beneficiary in, delivering a secure, affordable and sustainable energy system and a well-functioning and competitive energy market or increasing the level of environmental protection compared to the level that would be achieved in absence of the subsidy. Such subsidies shall not relieve the beneficiary from liabilities arising from its responsibilities as a polluter under the law of the relevant Party.
__Subsidies to air carriers for the operation of routes__

15. Subsidies shall not be granted to an air carrier56 for the operation of routes except:
    (a) where there is a public service obligation, in accordance with Article 3.3 [Services of public economic interest];
    (b) in special cases where this funding provides benefits for society at large; or
    (c.) as start-up subsidies for opening new routes to regional airports providing that it increases the mobility of citizens and stimulates regional development.

##### Article 3.6: Use of subsidies
Each Party shall ensure that economic actors use subsidies only for the specific purpose for which they are granted.

##### Article 3.7: Transparency
1. With respect to any subsidy granted or maintained within its territory, each Party shall within six months from the granting of the subsidy make publicly available, on an official website or a public database, the following information:
    (a) the legal basis and policy objective or purpose of the subsidy;
    (b) the name of the recipient of the subsidy when available;
    (c.) the date of the grant of the subsidy, the duration of the subsidy and any other time limits attached to the subsidy; and
    (d) the amount of the subsidy or the amount budgeted for the subsidy.

2. For subsidies in the form of tax measures, the information shall be made public within one year from the date the tax declaration is due. The transparency obligations for subsidies in the form
(^56) For greater certainty, this is without prejudice to paragraphs Article 3.2(1) and (2) [Scope and exceptions].
of tax measures concern the same information as listed in paragraph 1, except for the information required under point (d) of that paragraph, which may be provided as a range.

3. In addition to the obligation set out in paragraph 1, the Parties shall make subsidy information available in accordance with paragraphs 4 or 5 below.

4. For the Union, compliance with paragraph 3 means that with respect to any subsidy granted or maintained within its territory, within six months from the grant of the subsidy, information is made publicly available, on an official website or a public database, that allows interested parties to assess the compliance with the principles set out in Article 3.4 [Principles].

5. For the United Kingdom, compliance with paragraph 3 means that the United Kingdom shall ensure that:
    (a) if an interested party communicates to the granting authority that it may apply for a review by a court or tribunal of (i) the grant of a subsidy by a granting authority or (ii) any relevant decision by the granting authority or the independent body or authority;
    (b) then, within 28 days of the request being made in writing, the granting authority, independent body or authority will provide that interested party with the information that allows the interested party to assess the application of the principles set out in Article 3.4 [Principles], subject to any proportionate restrictions which pursue a legitimate objective, such as commercial sensitivity, confidentiality or legal privilege.
The information referred to in point (b) of the first sub-paragraph shall be provided to the interested party for the purposes of enabling it to make an informed decision as to whether to make a claim or to understand and properly identify the issues in dispute in the proposed claim.

6. For the purposes of this Article, Article 3.10 [Courts and tribunals] and Article 3.11 [Recovery], “interested party” means any natural or legal person, economic actor or association of economic actors whose interest might be affected by the granting of a subsidy, in particular the beneficiary, economic actors competing with the beneficiary or relevant trade associations.

7. The obligations in this Article are without prejudice to the obligations of the Parties under their respective laws concerning freedom of information or access to documents.

##### Article 3.8: Consultations on subsidy control
1. If a Party considers that a subsidy has been granted by the other Party or that there is clear evidence that the other Party intends to grant a subsidy and that the granting of the subsidy has or could have a negative effect on trade or investment between the Parties, it may request the other Party to provide an explanation of how the Principles referred to in Article 3.4 [Principles] have been respected with regard to that subsidy.

2. A Party may also request the information listed in Article 3.7(1) [Transparency] to the extent that the information has not already been made publicly available on an official website or a public database as referred to in Article 3.7(1) [Transparency], or to the extent that the information has not been made available in an easily and readily accessible manner.

3. The other Party shall provide the requested information in writing no later than 60 days of the receipt of the request. If any requested information cannot be provided, that Party shall explain the absence of such information in its written response.

4. If after receiving the information requested, the requesting Party still considers that the subsidy granted or intended to be granted by the other Party has or could have a negative effect on trade or investment between the Parties, the requesting Party may request consultations within the Trade Specialised Committee on the Level Playing Field for Open and Fair Competition and Sustainable Development. The request shall be in writing and shall include an explanation of the requesting Party’s reasons for requesting the consultation.

5. The Trade Specialised Committee on the Level Playing Field for Open and Fair Competition and Sustainable Development shall make every attempt to arrive at a mutually satisfactory resolution of the matter. It shall hold its first meeting within 30 days of the request for consultation.

6. The timeframes for the consultations referred to in paragraphs 3 and 5 may be extended by agreement between the Parties.

##### Article 3.9: Independent authority or body and cooperation
1. Each Party shall establish or maintain an operationally independent authority or body with an appropriate role in its subsidy control regime. That independent authority or body shall have the necessary guarantees of independence in exercising its operational functions and shall act impartially.

2. The Parties shall encourage their respective independent authorities or bodies to cooperate with each other on issues of common interest within their respective functions, including the application of Articles 3.1 [Definitions] to 3.7 [Transparency] as applicable, within the limits established by their respective legal frameworks. The Parties, or their respective independent authorities or bodies, may agree upon a separate framework regarding cooperation between those independent authorities.

##### Article 3.10: Courts and tribunals
1. Each Party shall ensure, in accordance with its general and constitutional laws and procedures, that its courts or tribunals are competent to:
    a) review subsidy decisions taken by a granting authority or, where relevant, the independent authority or body for compliance with that Party’s law implementing Article 3.4 [Principles];
    b) review any other relevant decisions of the independent authority or body and any relevant failure to act;
    c.) impose remedies that are effective in relation to points a) or b), including suspension, prohibition or requirement of action by the granting authority, the award of damages, and recovery of subsidy from its beneficiary if and to the extent they are available under the respective laws on the date of entry into force of this Agreement;
    d) hear claims from interested parties in respect of subsidies that are subject to this Chapter; where an interested party has standing to bring a claim in respect of a subsidy under that Party’s law.

2. Each Party shall have the right to intervene with the permission, where required, of the court or tribunal concerned, in accordance with the general laws and procedures of the other Party in cases referred to in paragraph 1.

3. Without prejudice to the obligations to maintain or, where necessary, to create the competencies, remedies and rights of intervention referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article, and Article 3.11 [Recovery], nothing in this Article requires either Party to create rights of action, remedies, procedures, or the scope or grounds of review of decisions of their respective public authorities, beyond those existing under its law on the date of entry into force of this Agreement.
Nothing in this Article requires either Party to widen the scope or grounds of review by its courts and tribunals of Acts of the United Kingdom Parliament, of acts of the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union, or of acts of the Council of the European Union beyond those existing under its law on the date of entry into force of this Agreement.^57

##### Article 3.11: Recovery
1. Each Party shall have in place an effective mechanism of recovery in respect of subsidies in accordance with the following provisions, without prejudice to other remedies that exist in that Party’s law.^58

2. Each Party shall ensure that, provided that the interested party as defined in Article 3.7(6) [Transparency] has challenged a decision to grant a subsidy before a court or a tribunal within the specified time period, as defined in paragraph 3 of this Article, recovery may be ordered if a court or tribunal of a Party makes a finding of a material error of law, in that:
    (a) a measure constituting a subsidy was not treated by the grantor as a subsidy;
    (b) the grantor of a subsidy has failed to apply the principles set out in Article 3.4 [Principles], as implemented in that Party’s law, or applied them in a manner which falls below the standard of review applicable in that Party’s law; or
    (c.) the grantor of a subsidy has, by deciding to grant that subsidy, acted outside the scope of its powers or misused those powers in relation to the principles set out in Article 3.4 [Principles], as implemented in that Party’s law.

3. For the purposes of this Article, the specified time period shall be determined as follows:
    (a) for the Union, it shall commence on the date on which information specified in Article 3.7(1), (2) and (4) [Transparency] was made available on the official website or public database and be no shorter than one month.
    (b) for the United Kingdom:
        (i) it shall commence on the date on which information specified in Article 3.7(1) and (2) [Transparency] was made available on the official website or public database;
(^57) For greater certainty, the law of the United Kingdom for the purposes of this Article does not include any law [i] having effect by virtue of section 2(1) of the European Communities Act 1972, as saved by section 1A of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, or [ii] passed or made under, or for a purpose specified in section 2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972.
(^58) For the United Kingdom, this Article requires a new remedy of recovery which would be available at the end of a successful judicial review, in accordance with the standard of review under national law, commenced within the specified time period; such review is not expanded in any other way, in accordance with Article 3.10(3) [Courts and tribunals]. No beneficiary would be able to raise a legitimate expectation to resist such recovery.
    (ii) it shall terminate one month later, unless, prior to that date, the interested party has requested information under the process specified in paragraph 5 of Article 3.7;
    (iii) once the interested party has received the information identified in Article 3.7(5)(b) sufficient for the purposes identified in that paragraph, there shall be a further one month period at the end of which the specified time period shall terminate;
    (iv) the date of receipt of the information in point (iii) will be the date on which the granting authority certifies that it has provided the information identified in Article 3.7(5)(b) [Transparency] sufficient for those purposes, irrespective of further or clarificatory correspondence after that date;
    (v) the time periods identified in points (i) to (iii) may be increased by legislation.

4. For the purposes of paragraph 3(b), in relation to schemes, the specified time period commences when the information under point (b) is published, not when subsequent payments are made, where:
    (a) a subsidy is ostensibly granted in accordance with the terms of a scheme;
    (b) the maker of the scheme has made publicly available the information required to be published by Article 3.7(1) and (2) [Transparency] in respect of the scheme; and
    (c.) the information provided about the scheme under point (b) contains information about the subsidy that would enable an interested party to determine whether it may be affected by the scheme, which at a minimum shall cover the purpose of the subsidy, the categories of beneficiary, the terms and conditions of eligibility for subsidy and the basis for the calculation of the subsidy (including any relevant conditions relating to subsidy ratios or amounts).

5. For the purposes of this Article, recovery of a subsidy is not required where a subsidy is granted on the basis of an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, of an act of the European Parliament and of the Council of the European Union, or of an act of the Council of the European Union.

6. Nothing in this Article prevents a Party from choosing to provide additional situations where recovery is a remedy, beyond those specified in this Article, in accordance with its law.

7. The Parties recognise that recovery is an important remedial tool in any system of subsidy control. At the request of either Party, the Parties shall, within the Partnership Council consider additional or alternative mechanisms for recovery, as well as corresponding amendments to this Article. Within the Partnership Council, either Party may propose amendments to allow for different arrangements for their respective mechanisms for recovery. A Party must consider a proposal made by the other Party in good faith and agree to it, provided that this Party considers that it contains arrangements which represent at least as effective a means of delivering recovery as the existing mechanisms of the other Party. The Partnership Council may then make corresponding amendments to this Article.^59
(^59) The Parties note that the United Kingdom will implement a new system of subsidy control subsequent to the entry into force of this Agreement.

##### Article 3.12: Remedial measures
1. A Party may deliver to the other Party a written request for information and consultations regarding a subsidy that it considers causes, or there is a serious risk that it will cause, a significant negative effect on trade or investment between the Parties. The requesting Party should provide in that request all relevant information to enable the Parties to find a mutually acceptable solution, including a description of the subsidy and the concerns of the requesting Party regarding its effect on trade or investment.

2. No later than 30 days from the date of delivery of the request the requested Party shall deliver a written response providing the requested information to the requesting Party, and the Parties shall enter into consultations, which shall be deemed concluded 60 days from the date of delivery of that request, unless the Parties agree otherwise. Such consultations, and in particular all information designated as confidential and positions taken by the Parties during consultations, shall be confidential, and shall be without prejudice to the rights of either Party in any further proceedings.

3. No earlier than 60 days from the date of delivery of the request referred to in paragraph 1, the requesting Party may unilaterally take appropriate remedial measures if there is evidence that a subsidy of the requested Party causes, or there is a serious risk that it will cause a significant negative effect on trade or investment between the Parties.

4. No earlier than 45 days from the date of delivery of the request referred to in paragraph 1, the requesting Party shall notify the requested Party of the remedial measures that it intends to take in accordance with paragraph 3. The requesting Party shall provide all relevant information in relation to the measures that it intends to take to enable the Parties to find a mutually acceptable solution. The requesting Party may not take those remedial measures earlier than 15 days from the date of delivery of the notification of those measures to the requested Party.

5. A Party’s assessment of the existence of a serious risk of a significant negative effect shall be based on facts and not merely on allegation, conjecture or remote possibility. The change in circumstances that would create a situation in which the subsidy would cause such a significant negative effect must be clearly predictable.

6. A Party’s assessment of the existence of a subsidy or of a significant negative effect on trade or investment between the Parties caused by the subsidy shall be based on reliable evidence and not merely on conjecture or remote possibility, and shall relate to identifiable goods, service suppliers or other economic actors, including, if relevant, in the case of subsidy schemes.

7. The Partnership Council may maintain an illustrative list of what would amount to a significant negative effect on trade or investment between the Parties within the meaning of paragraphs 1 and 3. This shall be without prejudice to the right of the Parties to take remedial measures.

8. The remedial measures taken pursuant to paragraph 3 shall be restricted to what is strictly necessary and proportionate in order to remedy the significant negative effect caused or to address the serious risk of such an effect. Priority shall be given to measures that will least disturb the functioning of this Agreement.

9. Within five days from the date on which the remedial measures referred to in paragraph 3 enter into effect and without having prior recourse to consultations in accordance with Article INST.13 [Consultations], the notified Party may request, in accordance with Article INST.14(2)
[Arbitration procedure], the establishment of an arbitration tribunal by means of a written request delivered to the requesting Party in order for the arbitration tribunal to decide whether:
    (a) a remedial measure taken by the requesting Party is inconsistent with paragraph 3 or 8;
    (b) the requesting Party did not participate in the consultations after the requested Party delivered the requested information and agreed to the holding of such consultations; or
    (c.) there was a failure to take or notify a remedial measure in accordance with the time periods referred to in paragraph 3 or 4 respectively.
That request shall not have a suspensive effect on the remedial measures. Furthermore, the arbitration tribunal shall not assess the application by the Parties of Articles 3.4 [Principles] and 3.5 [Prohibited subsidies and subsidies subject to conditions].

10. The arbitration tribunal established following the request referred to in paragraph 9 shall conduct its proceedings in accordance with Article INST.34B [Special procedures for remedial measures and rebalancing] and deliver its final ruling within 30 days from its establishment.

11. In the case of a finding against the respondent Party, the respondent Party shall, at the latest 30 days from the date of delivery of the ruling of the arbitration tribunal, deliver a notification to the complaining Party of any measure that it has taken to comply with that ruling.

12. Following a finding against the respondent Party in the procedure referred to in paragraph 10, the complaining Party may request the arbitration tribunal, within 30 days from its ruling, to determine a level of suspension of obligations under this Agreement or a supplementing agreement not exceeding the level equivalent to the nullification or impairment caused by the application of the remedial measures, if it finds that the inconsistency of the remedial measures with paragraphs 3 or 8 is significant. The request shall propose a level of suspension of obligations in accordance with the principles set out in Article INST.34C [Suspension of obligations for the purposes of Article LPFS.3.12(12)[Remedial measures], Article FISH.9(5) and Article FISH.14(6)]. The complaining Party may suspend obligations under this Agreement or a supplementing agreement in accordance with the level of suspension of obligations determined by the arbitration tribunal. Such suspension shall not be applied sooner than 15 days following such ruling.

13. A Party shall not invoke the WTO Agreement or any other international agreement to preclude the other Party from taking measures pursuant to this Article, including where those measures consist in the suspension of obligations under this Agreement or under a supplementing agreement.

14. For the purposes of assessing whether imposing or maintaining remedial measures on imports of the same product is restricted to what is strictly necessary or proportionate for the purposes of this Article, a Party:
    (a) shall take into account countervailing measures applied or maintained pursuant to Article GOODS.17(3) [Trade Remedies] of Title IV [Trade in goods]; and
    (b) may take into account anti-dumping measures applied or maintained pursuant to Article GOODS.17(3) [Trade Remedies] of Title IV [Trade in goods].

15. A Party shall not apply simultaneously a remedial measure under this Article and a rebalancing measure under Article 9.4 [Rebalancing] to remedy the impact on trade or investment caused directly by the same subsidy.

16. If the Party against which remedial measures were taken does not submit a request pursuant to paragraph 9 of this Article within the time period laid down in that paragraph, that Party may initiate the arbitration procedure referred to in Article INST.14 [Arbitration procedure] to challenge a remedial measure on the grounds set out in paragraph 9 of this Article without having prior recourse to consultations in accordance with Article INST.13 [Consultations]. An arbitration tribunal shall treat the issue as a case of urgency for the purpose of Article INST.19 [Urgent proceedings].

17. For the purposes of the proceedings under paragraphs 9 and 16, in assessing whether a remedial measure is strictly necessary or proportionate, the arbitration tribunal shall pay due regard to the principles set out in paragraphs 5 and 6, as well as to paragraphs 13, 14 and 15.

##### Article 3.13: Dispute settlement
1. Subject to paragraphs 2 and 3, Title I [Dispute settlement] of Part Six [Dispute settlement and horizontal provisions] applies to disputes between the Parties concerning the interpretation and application of this Chapter, except for Articles 3.9 [Independent authority or body and cooperation] and 3.10 [Courts and tribunals].

2. An arbitration tribunal shall have no jurisdiction regarding:
    (a) an individual subsidy, including whether such a subsidy has respected the principles set out in paragraph 1 of Article 3.4 [Principles], other than with regard to the conditions set out in Article 3.5(2) [Unlimited state guarantees], (3) to (5) [Rescue and restructuring], (8) to (11) [Export subsidies] and (12) [Subsidies contingent upon the use of domestic content]; and
    (b) whether the recovery remedy within the meaning of Article 3.11 [Recovery] has been correctly applied in any individual case.

3. Title I [Dispute settlement] of Part Six [Dispute settlement and horizontal provisions] shall apply to Article 3.12 [Remedial measures] in accordance with that Article and Article INST.34B [Special procedures for remedial measures and rebalancing].

1. The Parties recognise the right of each Party to determine its future policies and priorities with respect to labour and social, environmental or climate protection, or with respect to subsidy control, in a manner consistent with each Party’s international commitments, including those under this Agreement. At the same time, the Parties acknowledge that significant divergences in these areas can be capable of impacting trade or investment between the Parties in a manner that changes the circumstances that have formed the basis for the conclusion of this Agreement.

2. If material impacts on trade or investment between the Parties are arising as a result of significant divergences between the Parties in the areas referred to in paragraph 1, either Party may take appropriate rebalancing measures to address the situation. Such measures shall be restricted with respect to their scope and duration to what is strictly necessary and proportionate in order to remedy the situation. Priority shall be given to such measures as will least disturb the functioning of this Agreement. A Party’s assessment of these impacts shall be based on reliable evidence and not merely on conjecture or remote possibility.

3. The following procedures shall apply to rebalancing measures taken under paragraph 2:
    (a) The concerned Party shall, without delay, notify the other Party through the Partnership Council of the rebalancing measures it intends to take , providing all relevant information. The Parties shall immediately enter into consultations. Consultations shall be deemed concluded within 14 days from the date of delivery of the notification, unless they are jointly concluded before that time limit.
    (b) If no mutually acceptable solution is found, the concerned Party may adopt rebalancing measures no sooner than five days from the conclusion of the consultations, unless the notified Party requests within the same five day period, in accordance with Article INST.14(2)
    [Arbitration procedure]^64, the establishment of an arbitration tribunal by means of a written request delivered to the other Party in order for the arbitration tribunal to decide whether the notified rebalancing measures are consistent with paragraph 2 of this Article.
    (c.) The arbitration tribunal shall deliver its final ruling within 30 days from its establishment. If the arbitration tribunal does not deliver its final ruling within that time period, the concerned Party may adopt the rebalancing measures no sooner than three days after the expiry of that 30 day time period. In that case, the other Party may take countermeasures proportionate to the adopted rebalancing measures until the arbitration tribunal delivers its ruling. Priority shall be given to such countermeasures as will least disturb the functioning of this Agreement. Point (a) shall apply mutatis mutandis to such countermeasures, which may be adopted no sooner than three days after the conclusion of consultations.
    (d) If the arbitration tribunal has found the rebalancing measures to be consistent with paragraph 2, the concerned Party may adopt the rebalancing measures as notified to the other Party.
    (e) If the arbitration tribunal has found the rebalancing measures to be inconsistent with paragraph 2, the concerned Party shall, within three days from the delivery of the ruling, notify the complaining Party of the measures^65 it intends to adopt to comply with the ruling of the arbitration tribunal. Articles INST.23(2) [Compliance review], INST.24 [Temporary remedies]^66 and INST.25 [Review of any measure taken to comply after the adoption of temporary remedies] shall apply mutatis mutandis, if the complaining Party considers that the notified measures are not in compliance with the ruling of the arbitration tribunal. The procedures under Articles INST.23(2) [Compliance review], INST.24 [Temporary measures] and INST.25 [Review of any measure taken to comply after the adoption of temporary remedies] shall have no suspensive effect on the application of the notified measures pursuant to this paragraph.
    (f) If rebalancing measures were adopted prior to the arbitration ruling in accordance with point (c.), any countermeasures adopted pursuant to that point shall be withdrawn immediately, and in no case later than five days, after delivery of the ruling of the arbitration tribunal.
    (g) A Party shall not invoke the WTO Agreement or any other international agreement to preclude the other Party from taking measures pursuant to paragraphs 2 and 3, including when those measures consist of suspension of obligations under this Agreement.
    (h) If the notified Party does not submit a request pursuant to point (b) within the time period laid down therein, that Party may without having prior recourse to consultations in accordance with Article INST.13 [Consultations] initiate the arbitration procedure referred to in Article INST.14 [Arbitration procedure]. An arbitration tribunal shall treat the issue as a case of urgency for the purpose of Article INST.19 [Urgent proceedings].

4. In order to ensure an appropriate balance between the commitments made by the Parties in this Agreement on a more durable basis, either Party may request, no sooner than four years after
(^64) For greater certainty, in this case the Party shall not have prior recourse to consultations in accordance with Article INST.13 [Consultations].
(^65) Such measures may include withdrawal or adjustment of the rebalancing measures, as appropriate
(^66) Suspension of obligations under Article INST.24 [Temporary remedies] shall be available only if rebalancing measures have in fact been applied.
the entry into force of this Agreement, a review of the operation of Heading One [Trade] of this Agreement. The Parties may agree that other Headings of this Agreement may be added to the review.

5. Such a review shall commence at a Party’s request, if that Party considers that measures under paragraphs 2 or 3 have been taken frequently by either or both Parties, or if a measure that has a material impact on the trade or investment between the Parties has been applied for a period of 12 months. For the purposes of this paragraph, the measures in question are those which were not challenged or not found by an arbitration tribunal to be strictly unnecessary pursuant to point (d) or (h) of paragraph 3. This review may commence earlier than four years after the entry into force of this Agreement.

6. The review requested pursuant to paragraph 4 or 5 shall begin within three months of the request and be completed within six months.

7. A review on the basis of paragraphs 4 or 5 may be repeated at subsequent intervals of no less than four years after the conclusion of the previous review. If a Party has requested a review under paragraphs 4 or 5, it may not request a further review under either paragraph 4 or 5 for at least four years from the conclusion of the previous review or, if applicable, from the entry into force of any amending agreement.

8. The review shall address whether the Agreement delivers an appropriate balance of rights and obligations between the Parties, in particular with regard to the operation of Heading One [Trade], and whether, as a result, there is a need for any modification of the terms of this Agreement.

9. The Partnership Council may decide that no action is required as a result of the review. If a Party considers that following the review there is a need for an amendment of this Agreement, the Parties shall use their best endeavours to negotiate and conclude an agreement making the necessary amendments. Such negotiations shall be limited to matters identified in the review.

10. If an amending agreement referred to in paragraph 9 is not concluded within one year from the date the Parties started negotiations, either Party may give notice to terminate Heading One [Trade] or any other Heading of the Agreement that was added to the review, or the Parties may decide to continue negotiations. If a Party terminates Heading One [Trade], Heading Three [Road transport] shall be terminated on the same date. The termination shall take effect three months after the date of such notice.

11. If Heading One [Trade] is terminated pursuant to paragraph 10, Heading Two [Aviation] shall be terminated at the same date, unless the Parties agree to integrate the relevant parts of Title XI [Level playing field for open and fair competition and sustainable development] in Heading Two [Aviation].

12. Title I [Dispute settlement] of Heading Six [Dispute settlement and horizontal arrangements] does not apply to paragraphs 4 to 9.

For the purposes of this paragraph, further non-compliance means that the question of non-compliance has already been raised between the competent authorities of the Parties.

6. This Article is without prejudice to the provisions of Title XI [Level playing field for open and fair competition and sustainable development] of Heading One, Article AIRTRN 11(4) [Non-Discrimination], Article AIRTRN 18 (4), (6) and (8) [Aviation Safety] and Article AIRTRN 19(12) [Aviation Security] and to the dispute settlement procedure laid down in Title I [Dispute Settlement] of Part Six or to the measures resulting therefrom.

##### AIRTRN.11: Non-Discrimination
1. Without prejudice to Title XI [Level playing field for open and fair competition and sustainable development] of Heading One, the Parties shall eliminate, within their respective jurisdictions, all forms of discrimination which would adversely affect the fair and equal opportunity of the air carriers of the other Party to compete in the exercise of the rights provided for in this Title.

2. A Party (the “initiating Party”) may proceed in accordance with paragraphs 3 to 6 where it considers that its air carriers’ fair and equal opportunities to compete in the exercise of the rights provided for in this Title are adversely affected by discrimination prohibited by paragraph 1.

3. The initiating Party shall submit a written request for consultations to the other Party (the “responding Party”). Consultations shall start within a period of 30 days from the receipt of the request, unless otherwise agreed by the Parties.

4. Where the initiating Party and the responding Party fail to reach agreement on the matter within 60 days from the receipt of the request for consultations referred to in paragraph 3, the initiating Party may take measures against all or part of the air carriers which have benefitted from discrimination prohibited by paragraph 1, including action to refuse, revoke, suspend, impose conditions on or limit the operating authorisations or technical permissions of the air carriers concerned.

5. The measures taken pursuant to paragraph 4 shall be appropriate, proportionate and restricted in their scope and duration to what is strictly necessary to mitigate the injury to the air carriers of the initiating Party and remove the undue advantage gained by the air carriers against which they are directed.

6. Where consultations have not resolved the matter or where measures have been taken pursuant to paragraph 4, a Party may have recourse to arbitration in accordance with Article INST.14 [Arbitration procedure], without having prior recourse to consultations in accordance with Article INST.13 [Consultations]. An arbitration tribunal shall treat the issue as a case of urgency for the purpose of Article INST.19 [Urgent Proceedings]. At the request of a Party, the tribunal may, pending its final ruling, order the adoption of interim relief measures, including the modification or suspension of measures taken by either Party under this Article.

7. Notwithstanding paragraph 2, the Parties shall not proceed under paragraphs 3 to 6 in relation to conduct falling under the scope of Title XI [Level playing field for open and fair competition and sustainable development] of Heading One.

##### Article AIRTRN.12: Doing business
1. The Parties agree that obstacles to doing business encountered by air carriers would hamper the benefits under this Title. The Parties agree to cooperate in removing obstacles to doing business for air carriers of both Parties where such obstacles may hamper commercial operations, create distortions to competition or affect equal opportunities to compete.

    (c.) it shall be possible for the sale and purchase of transport and related services by the air carriers of the Parties, at the discretion of the air carrier, to be denominated in pounds sterling if the sale or purchase takes place in the territory of the United Kingdom, or, if the sale or purchase take place in the territory of a Member State, to be denominated in the currency of that Member State;
    (d) the air carriers of each Party shall be permitted to pay for local expenses in local currency, at their discretion;
    (e) the air carriers of each Party shall be permitted, on demand, to remit revenues obtained in the territory of the other Party from the sale of air transport services and associated activities directly linked to air transport in excess of sums locally disbursed, at any time, in any way, to the country of their choice. Prompt conversion and remittance shall be permitted without restrictions or taxation in respect thereof at the market rate of exchange applicable to current transactions and remittance on the date the carrier makes the initial application for remittance and shall not be subject to any charges except those normally made by banks for carrying out such conversion and remittance.

6. As regards intermodal transport:
    (a) in relation to the transport of passengers, the Parties shall not subject surface transport providers to laws and regulations governing air transport on the sole basis that such surface transport is held out by an air carrier under its own name;
    (b) subject to any conditions and qualifications set out in Title II [SERVICES AND INVESTMENT] of Heading One and its Annexes and in Title I [Transport of Goods by Road] of Heading Three and its Annex, air carriers of each Party shall be permitted, without restriction, to employ in connection with international air transport any surface transport for cargo to or from any points in the territories of the Parties, or in third countries, including transport to and from all airports with customs facilities, and including, where applicable, the right to transport cargo in bond under applicable laws and regulations. Such cargo, whether moving by surface or by air, shall have access to airport customs processing and facilities. Air carriers may elect to perform their own surface transport or to provide it through arrangements, including code share, with other surface transport providers, including surface transport operated by other air carriers and indirect providers of cargo air transport. Such inter-modal cargo services may be offered as a through service and at a single price for the air and surface transport combined, provided that shippers are informed as to the providers of the transport involved.

##### Article AIRTRN.15: User charges
1. User charges that may be imposed by one Party on the air carriers of the other Party for the use of air navigation and air traffic control shall be cost-related and non-discriminatory. In any event, any such user charges shall be assessed on the air carriers of the other Party on terms not less favourable than the most favourable terms available to any other air carrier in like circumstances at the time the charges are applied.

2. Without prejudice to Article AIRTRN.13(5) [Commercial Operations], each Party shall ensure that user charges other than those mentioned in paragraph 1 that may be imposed on the air carriers of the other Party are just, reasonable, not unjustly discriminatory, and equitably apportioned among categories of users. User charges imposed on the air carriers of the other Party may reflect, but not exceed, the full cost of providing appropriate airport, airport environmental and aviation security facilities and services at the airport or within the airport system. Such charges may include a reasonable return on assets after depreciation. Facilities and services for which user charges are imposed shall be provided on an efficient and economic basis. In any event, any such user charges shall be assessed on the air carrier of the other Party on terms no less favourable than the most favourable terms available to any other air carrier in like circumstances at the time the charges are applied.

3. In order to ensure the correct application of the principles set out in paragraphs 1 and 2, each Party shall ensure that consultations take place between the competent charging authorities or bodies in its territory and the air carriers using the services and facilities concerned and that the competent charging authorities or bodies and the air carriers exchange such information as may be necessary. Each Party shall ensure that the competent charging authorities provide users with reasonable notice of any proposal for changes in user charges to enable users to express their views before any changes are made.

##### Article AIRTRN.16: Tariffs

##### Article AIRTRN.18: Aviation safety
1. The Parties reaffirm the importance of close cooperation in the field of aviation safety.

2. Certificates of airworthiness, certificates of competency and licences issued or rendered valid by one Party and still in force shall be recognised as valid by the other Party and its competent authorities, for the purpose of operating air services under this Title, provided that such certificates or licences were issued or rendered valid pursuant to, and in conformity with, as a minimum, the relevant international standards established under the Convention.

3. Each Party may request consultations at any time concerning the safety standards maintained and administered by the other Party in areas relating to aeronautical facilities, flight crew, aircraft and the operation of aircraft. Such consultations shall take place within 30 days of the request.

4. If, following such consultations, one Party finds that the other Party does not effectively maintain and administer safety standards in the areas referred to in paragraph 2 that are at least equal to the minimum standards established at that time pursuant to the Convention, the first Party shall notify the other Party of those findings and the steps considered necessary to conform with those minimum standards, and the other Party shall take appropriate corrective action. Failure by the other Party to take appropriate action within 15 days or such other period as may be agreed shall be grounds for the requesting Party to refuse, revoke, suspend, impose conditions on or limit the operating authorisations or technical permissions, or to otherwise refuse, revoke, suspend, impose conditions on or limit the operations of the air carriers under the safety oversight of the other Party.

5. Any aircraft operated by, or under a lease arrangement on behalf of, an air carrier or air carriers of one Party may, while within the territory of the other Party, be made the subject of a ramp inspection, provided that this does not lead to unreasonable delay in the operation of the aircraft.

6. The ramp inspection or series of ramp inspections can give rise to:
    (a) serious concerns that an aircraft or the operation of an aircraft does not comply with the minimum standards established at that time pursuant to the Convention; or
    (b) serious concerns that there is a lack of effective maintenance and administration of safety standards established at that time pursuant to the Convention.
In the event that the Party that conducted the ramp inspection or inspections establishes serious concerns as referred to in point (a) or (b), it shall notify the competent authorities of the other Party that are responsible for the safety oversight of the air carrier operating the aircraft of such findings and inform them of the steps considered necessary to conform with those minimum standards. Failure to take appropriate corrective action within 15 days or such other period as may be agreed shall constitute grounds for the first Party to refuse, revoke, suspend, impose conditions on or limit the operating authorisations or technical permissions or to otherwise refuse, revoke, suspend, impose conditions on or limit the operations of the air carrier operating the aircraft.

7. In the event that access for the purpose of undertaking a ramp inspection of an aircraft operated by the air carrier or air carriers of one Party in accordance with paragraph 5 is denied, the other Party shall be free to infer that serious concerns as referred to in paragraph 6 arise and proceed in accordance with paragraph 6.

8. Each Party reserves the right to immediately revoke, suspend or limit the operating authorisations or technical permissions or to otherwise suspend or limit the operations of an air carrier or air carriers of the other Party, if the first Party concludes as a result of a ramp inspection, a series of ramp inspections, a denial of access for ramp inspection, consultation or otherwise, that immediate action is essential to the safety of an air carrier operation. The Party taking such measures shall promptly inform the other Party, providing reasons for its action.

9. Any action by one Party in accordance with paragraphs 4, 6 or 8 shall be discontinued once the basis for the taking of that action ceases to exist.

10. Where measures have been taken by a Party pursuant to paragraphs 4, 6 or 8, in the event of a dispute a Party may have recourse to arbitration in accordance with Article INST.14 [Arbitration procedure], without having prior recourse to consultations in accordance with Article INST.13 [Consultations]. An arbitration tribunal shall treat the issue as a case of urgency for the purpose of Article INST.19 [Urgent Proceedings]. At the request of the complaining Party, the tribunal may, pending its final ruling, order the adoption of interim relief measures, including the modification or suspension of measures taken by either Party under this Article.

##### Article AIRTRN.19: Aviation security
1. The Parties shall provide upon request all necessary assistance to each other to address any threat to the security of civil aviation, including the prevention of acts of unlawful seizure of civil aircraft and other unlawful acts against the safety of such aircraft, of their passengers and crew, airports and air navigation facilities, and any other threat to the security of civil aviation.

2. The Parties shall, in their mutual relations, act in conformity with the aviation security standards established by ICAO. They shall require that operators of the aircraft in their registries and the operators of airports in their territory, act, at least, in conformity with such aviation security standards. Each Party shall, on request, provide the other Party notification of any difference between its laws, regulations and practices and the aviation security standards referred to in this paragraph. Each Party may at any time request consultations, to be held without delay, with the other Party to discuss those differences.

3. Each Party shall ensure that effective measures are taken within its territory to protect civil aviation against acts of unlawful interference, including, but not limited to, screening of passengers and their cabin baggage, screening of hold baggage, screening and security controls for persons other than passengers, including crew, and their items carried, screening and security controls for cargo, mail, in-flight and airport supplies, and access control to airside and security restricted areas. Each Party agrees that the security provisions of the other Party relating to the admission to, operating within, or departure from its territory of aircraft shall be observed.

4. The Parties shall endeavour to cooperate on aviation security matters to the highest extent, to exchange information on threat, vulnerability and risk, subject to the mutual agreement of appropriate arrangements for the secure transfer, use, storage and disposal of classified information, to discuss and share best practices, performance and detection standards of security equipment, compliance monitoring best practices and results, and in any other area that the Parties may identify. In particular, the Parties shall endeavour to develop and maintain cooperation arrangements between technical experts on the development and recognition of aviation security standards with the aim of facilitating such cooperation, reducing administrative duplication and fostering early notice and prior discussion of new security initiatives and requirements.

5. Each Party shall make available to the other Party on request the results of audits carried out by ICAO and the corrective actions taken by the audited state, subject to the mutual agreement of appropriate arrangements for the secure transfer, use, storage and disposal of such information.

6. The Parties agree to cooperate on security inspections undertaken by them in the territory of either Party through the establishment of mechanisms, including administrative arrangements, for the reciprocal exchange of information on results of such security inspections. The Parties agree to consider positively requests to participate, as observers, in security inspections undertaken by the other Party.

7. Subject to paragraph 9, and with full regard and mutual respect for the other Party’s sovereignty, a Party may adopt security measures for entry into its territory. Where possible, that Party shall take into account the security measures already applied by the other Party and any views that the other Party may offer. Each Party recognises that nothing in this Article limits the right of a Party to refuse entry into its territory of any flight or flights that it deems to present a threat to its security.

8. A Party may take emergency measures to meet a specific security threat. Such measures shall be notified immediately to the other Party. Without prejudice to the need to take immediate action in order to protect aviation security, when considering security measures, a Party shall evaluate possible adverse effects on international air transport and, unless constrained by law, shall take such effects into account when it determines what measures are necessary and appropriate to address the security concerns.

9. With regard to air services bound for its territory, a Party may not require security measures to be implemented in the territory of the other Party. Where a Party considers that a specific threat urgently requires the implementation of temporary measures in addition to the measures already in place in the territory of the other Party, it shall inform the other Party of the particulars of that threat to the extent consistent with the need to protect security information, and of the proposed measures. The other Party shall give positive consideration to such a proposal and may decide to implement additional measures as it deems necessary. Such measures shall be proportionate and limited in time.

10. When an incident or threat of an incident of unlawful seizure of civil aircraft or other unlawful acts against the safety of aircraft, passengers, crew, airports or air navigation facilities occurs, the Parties shall assist each other by facilitating communications and other appropriate measures intended to rapidly and safely terminate such incident or threat.

11. Each Party shall take all measures it finds practicable to ensure that an aircraft subjected to an act of unlawful seizure or other acts of unlawful interference which is on the ground in its territory is detained on the ground unless its departure is necessitated by the overriding duty to protect human life. Where practicable, such measures shall be taken on the basis of consultations between the Parties.

12. When a Party has reasonable grounds to believe that the other Party does not comply with this Article, that Party may request immediate consultations with the other Party. Such consultations shall start within 30 days of the receipt of such a request. Failure to reach a satisfactory agreement within 15 days or such other period as may be agreed from the date of such request shall constitute grounds for the Party that requested the consultations to take action to refuse, revoke, suspend, impose conditions on or limit the operating authorisation and technical permissions of an air carrier or air carriers of the other Party to ensure compliance with this Article. When required by an emergency, or to prevent further non-compliance with this Article, a Party may take interim action prior to the expiry of the 15 day-period referred to in this paragraph.

13. Any action taken in accordance with paragraph 8 shall be discontinued when the Party in question considers that the action is no longer required or has been superseded by other measures to mitigate the threat. Any action taken in accordance with paragraph 12 shall be discontinued upon compliance by the other Party with this Article. In the case of action taken in accordance with paragraph 8 or 12, this may be discontinued as mutually agreed by the Parties.

14. Where measures or actions have been taken in accordance with paragraphs 7, 8, 9 or 12, a Party may have recourse to the dispute settlement provisions of Title I [Dispute settlement] of Part Six. An arbitration tribunal shall treat the issue as a case of urgency for the purpose of Article INST.19 [Urgent Proceedings].

In respect of the Union, the competent authorities referred to in the first part of this paragraph shall be those of the Member States in whose territories passengers are picked up or set down and whose territories are crossed without passengers being picked up or set down.

2. The competent authorities whose agreement has been requested shall notify the authorising authority of their decision regarding the application within four months. This time limit shall be calculated from the date of receipt of the request for agreement which is shown in the acknowledgement of receipt. If the decision received from the competent authorities whose agreement has been requested is negative, it shall contain a proper statement of reasons. If the authorising authority does not receive a reply within four months, the competent authorities consulted shall be deemed to have given their agreement and the authorising authority may grant the authorisation.
The competent authorities whose territory is crossed without passengers being picked up or set down may notify the authorising authority of their comments within four months.

3. In respect of services that had been authorised under Regulation (EC) No 1073/2009 of the European Parliament and Council^70 before the end of the transition period and in respect of which the authorisation lapses at the end of the transition period, the following shall apply:
    (a) where, subject to the changes necessary to comply with Article X+2, the operating conditions are the same as those having been set in the authorisation granted under Regulation (EC) No 1073/2009, the relevant authorising authority under this Title may, on application or otherwise, issue the road transport operator with a corresponding authorisation granted under this Title. Where such an authorisation is issued, the agreement of the competent authorities in whose territories passengers are picked up or set down, as referred to in paragraph 2, shall be deemed to be provided. Those competent authorities and the competent authorities whose territory is crossed without passengers being picked up or set down may, at any time, notify the authorising authority of any comments they may have;
    (b) where point (a) is applied, the validity period of the corresponding authorisation granted under this Title shall not extend beyond the last day of the validity period specified in the authorisation previously granted under Regulation (EC) No 1073/2009.

4. The authorising authority shall take a decision on the application no later than six months from the date of submission of the application by the road passenger transport operator.

5. Authorisation shall be granted unless:
    (a) the applicant is unable to provide the service which is the subject of the application with equipment directly available to the applicant;
    (b) the applicant has not complied with national or international legislation on road transport, and in particular the conditions and requirements relating to authorisations for international road passenger services, or has committed serious infringements of a Party's road transport legislation in particular with regard to the rules applicable to vehicles and driving and rest periods for drivers;
    (c.) in the case of an application for renewal of authorisation, the conditions of authorisation have not been complied with;
    (d) a Party decides on the basis of a detailed analysis that the service concerned would seriously affect the viability of a comparable service covered by one or more public service contracts conforming to the Party's law on the direct sections concerned. In such a case, the Party shall set up criteria, on a non-discriminatory basis, for determining whether the service applied for would seriously affect the viability of the abovementioned comparable service and shall communicate them to the other Party referred to in paragraph 1; or
    (e) a Party decides on the basis of a detailed analysis that the principal purpose of the service is not to carry passengers between stops located in the territories of the Parties.
(^70) Regulation (EC) No 1073/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 October 2009 on common rules for access to the international market for coach and bus services, and amending Regulation (EC) No 561/2006 (recast) (OJ EU L 300, 14.11.2009, p. 88).

The fact that a road passenger transport operator of a Party offers lower prices than those offered by other road passenger transport operators or the fact that the link in question is already operated by other road passenger transport operators shall not in itself constitute justification for rejecting the application.

6. Having completed the procedure laid down in paragraphs 1 to 5, the authorising authority shall grant the authorisation or formally refuse the application.
Decisions rejecting an application shall state the reasons on which they are based. The Parties shall ensure that transport undertakings are given the opportunity to make representations in the event of their application being rejected.

3. In the event of a minor alteration to the operating conditions, in particular the adjustment of intervals, fares and timetables, the authorising authority needs only supply the competent authorities of the other Party with information relating to the alteration. Changing the timetables or intervals in a manner that affects the timing of controls at the borders between the Parties or at third country borders shall not be considered a minor alteration.

### Chapter three: Arrangements on access to waters and resources
##### Article FISH.6: Fishing opportunities
1. By 31 January of each year, the Parties shall cooperate to set the schedule for consultations with the aim of agreeing TACs for the stocks listed in Annex FISH.1 for the following year or years.
That schedule shall take into account other annual consultations among coastal States that affect either or both of the Parties.

2. The Parties shall hold consultations annually to agree, by 10 December of each year, the TACs for the following year for the stocks listed in Annex FISH.1. This shall include an early exchange of views on priorities as soon as advice on the level of the TACs is received. The Parties shall agree those TACs:
    (a) on the basis of the best available scientific advice, as well as other relevant factors, including socio-economic aspects; and
    (b) in compliance with any applicable multi-year strategies for conservation and management agreed by the Parties.

3. The Parties’ shares of the TACs for the stocks listed in Annex FISH.1 shall be allocated between the Parties in accordance with the quota shares set out in that Annex.

4. Annual consultations may also cover, inter alia:
    (a) transfers of parts of one Party’s shares of TACs to the other Party;
    (b) a list of stocks for which fishing is prohibited;   
    (c.) the determination of the TAC for any stock which is not listed in Annex FISH.1 or Annex FISH.2 and the Parties’ respective shares of those stocks;
    (d) measures for fisheries management, including, where appropriate, fishing effort limits;
    (e) stocks of mutual interest to the Parties other than those listed in the Annexes to this Heading.

5. The Parties may hold consultations with the aim of agreeing amended TACs if either Party so requests.

6. A written record documenting the arrangements made between the Parties as a result of consultations under this Article shall be produced and signed by the heads of delegation of the Parties.

7. Each Party shall give sufficient notice to the other Party before setting or amending TACs for the stocks listed in Annex FISH.3.

8. The Parties agree to set up a mechanism for voluntary in-year transfers of fishing opportunities between the Parties, to take place each year. The Specialised Committee on Fisheries shall decide on the details of this mechanism. The Parties shall consider making transfers of fishing opportunities for stocks which are, or are projected to be, underfished available at market value through this mechanism.

##### Article FISH.7: Provisional TACs
1. If the Parties have not agreed a TAC for a stock listed in Annex FISH.1 or Annex FISH.2A or B by 10 December, they shall immediately resume consultations with the continued aim of agreeing the TAC. The Parties shall engage frequently with a view to exploring all possible options for reaching agreement in the shortest possible time.

2. If a stock listed in Annex FISH.1 or Annex FISH.2A and B remains without an agreed TAC on 20 December, each Party shall set a provisional TAC corresponding to the level advised by ICES, applying from 1 January.

3. By derogation from paragraph 2, the TACs for special stocks shall be set in accordance with guidelines adopted under paragraph 5.

4. For the purposes of this article, “special stocks” means:
    (a) stocks where the ICES advice is for a zero TAC;
    (b) stocks caught in a mixed fishery, if that stock or another stock in the same fishery is vulnerable; or
    (c.) other stocks which the Parties consider require special treatment.

5. The Specialised Committee on Fisheries shall adopt guidelines by 1 July 2021 for the setting of provisional TACs for special stocks.

6. Each year when advice is received from ICES on TACs, the Parties shall discuss, as a priority, the special stocks and the application of any guidelines set under paragraph 5 to the setting of provisional TACs by each Party.

7. Each Party shall set its share for each of the provisional TACs, which shall not exceed its share as set out in the corresponding Annex.

8. The provisional TACs and shares referred to in paragraphs 2, 3 and 7 shall apply until agreement is reached under paragraph 1.

9. Each Party shall, immediately, notify the other Party of its provisional TACs under paragraphs 2 and 3 and its provisional share of each of those TACs under paragraph 7.

##### Article FISH.8: Access to waters
1. Provided that TACs have been agreed each Party shall grant vessels of the other Party access to fish in its waters in the relevant ICES sub-areas that year. Access shall be granted at a level and on conditions determined in those annual consultations.

2. The Parties may agree, in annual consultations, further specific access conditions in relation to:
    (a) the fishing opportunities agreed;
    (b) any multi-year strategies for non-quota stocks developed under point (c.) of Article FISH.16(1) [Specialised Committee on Fisheries]; and
    (c.) any technical and conservation measures agreed by the Parties, without prejudice to Article FISH.4 [Fisheries management].

3. The Parties shall conduct the annual consultations, including on the level and conditions of access referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, in good faith and with the objective of ensuring a mutually satisfactory balance between the interests of both Parties.

4. In particular, the outcome of the consultations should normally result in each Party granting:
    (a) access to fish the stocks listed in Annex FISH.1 and Annex FISH.2.A, B and F in each other’s EEZ (or if access is granted under point (c), in EEZs and in the divisions mentioned in that point) at a level that is reasonably commensurate with the Parties’ respective shares of the TACs;
    (b) access to fish non-quota stocks in each other’s EEZ (or if access is granted under point (c.), in EEZs and in the divisions mentioned in that point), at a level that at least equates to the average tonnage fished by that Party in the waters of the other Party during the period 2012-2016; and
    (c.) access to the waters of the Parties between six and twelve nautical miles from the baseline in ICES divisions 4c and 7d-g for qualifying vessels to the extent that Union fishing vessels and United Kingdom fishing vessels had access to those waters on 31 December 2020.
For the purposes of point (c.), ‘qualifying vessel’ means a vessel of a Party which fished in the zone mentioned in the previous sentence in four of the years between 2012 and 2016, or its direct replacement.
Annual consultations referred to in point (c.) may include appropriate financial commitments and quota transfers between the Parties.

5. During the application of a provisional TAC, and pending an agreed TAC, the Parties shall grant provisional access to fish in the relevant ICES sub-areas as follows
    (a) for stocks listed in Annex FISH.1 and non-quota stocks, from 1 January until 31 March at the levels provided for in paragraph 4(a) and (b);
    (b) for stocks listed in Annex FISH.2 from 1 January until 14 February at the levels provided for in paragraph 4(a); and
    (c.) in relation to access to fish in the six to twelve nautical miles zone, access in accordance with paragraph 4(c) from 1 January to 31 January at a level equivalent to the average monthly tonnage fished in that zone in the previous 3 months.
Such access, for each of the relevant stocks in points (a) and (b), shall be in proportion to the average percentage of a Party’s share of the annual TAC which that Party’s vessels fished in the other Party’s waters in the relevant ICES sub-areas during the same period of the previous three calendar years. The same shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to access to fish non-quota stocks.
By 15 January in relation to the situation in point (c) of this paragraph, by 31 January in respect of the stocks listed in Annex FISH.2, and by 15 March in respect of all other stocks, each Party shall notify the other Party of the change in the level and conditions of access to waters that will apply as of 1 February in relation to the situation in point (c), as of 15 February in respect of the stocks listed in Annex FISH.2, and as of 1 April in respect of all other stocks for the relevant ICES sub-areas.

6. Without prejudice to Article FISH.7(1) and (8)[Provisional TACs], after the period of one month in relation to the situation in point (c) of paragraph 5, one and a half months in respect of the stocks listed in Annex FISH.2 and three months in respect of all other stocks, the Parties shall seek to agree further provisional access arrangements at the appropriate geographical level with the aim of minimising disruption to fishing activities.

7. In granting access under paragraph 1, a Party may take into account compliance of individual or groups of vessels with the applicable rules in its waters during the preceding year, and measures taken by the other Party pursuant to Article FISH.5(2) [Authorisations, compliance and enforcement] during the preceding year.

8. This Article shall apply subject to Annex FISH.4 [Protocol on access to waters].

##### Article FISH.9: Compensatory measures in case of withdrawal or reduction of access
1. Following a notification by a Party (“host Party”) under Article FISH.8(5)[Access to waters], the other Party (“fishing Party”) may take compensatory measures commensurate to the economic and societal impact of the change in the level and conditions of access to waters. Such impact shall be measured on the basis of reliable evidence and not merely on conjecture and remote possibility. Giving priority to those compensatory measures which will least disturb the functioning of this Agreement, the fishing Party may suspend, in whole or in part, access to its waters and the preferential tariff treatment granted to fishery products under Article GOODS.5[Prohibition and customs duties].

2. A compensatory measure referred to in paragraph 1 may take effect at the earliest seven days after the fishing Party has given notice to the host Party of the intended suspension under paragraph 1 and, in any case, not earlier than 1 February in relation to the situation in point (c) of Article 8(5)[Access to waters], 15 February in respect of Annex FISH.2 and 1 April in respect of other stocks. The Parties shall consult within the Specialised Committee with a view to reaching a mutually agreeable solution. That notification shall identify:
    (a) the date upon which the fishing Party intends to suspend; and
    (b) the obligations to be suspended and the level of the intended suspension.

3. After the notification of the compensatory measures in accordance with paragraph 2, the host Party may request the establishment of an arbitration tribunal pursuant to Article INST.14 [Arbitration procedure] of Title I [Dispute settlement] of Part Six, without having recourse to consultations in accordance with Article INST.13 [Consultations]. The arbitration tribunal may only review the conformity of the compensatory measures with paragraph 1. The arbitration tribunal shall treat the issue as a case of urgency for the purpose of Article INST.19 [Urgent proceedings] of Title I [Dispute settlement] of Part Six.

4. When the conditions for taking compensatory measures referred to in paragraph 1 are no longer met, such measures shall be withdrawn immediately.

5. Following a finding against the fishing Party in the procedure referred to in paragraph 3, the host Party may request the arbitration tribunal, within 30 days from its ruling, to determine a level of suspension of obligations under this Agreement not exceeding the level equivalent to the nullification or impairment caused by the application of the compensatory measures, if it finds that the inconsistency of the compensatory measures with paragraph 1 is significant. The request shall propose a level of suspension in accordance with the principles set out in paragraph 1 and any relevant principles set out in Article INST.34C [Suspension of obligations for the purposes of LPFS.3.12(12), Article FISH.9(5) and Article FISH.14(7)]. The host Party may apply the level of suspension of obligations under this Agreement in accordance with the level of suspension determined by the arbitration tribunal, no sooner than 15 days following such ruling.

6. A Party shall not invoke the WTO Agreement or any other international agreement to preclude the other Party from suspending obligations under this Article.

    (a) prior notification between three and five hours before landing fresh fisheries products into the Union’s territory;
    (b) prior notification between one and three hours of the validated catch certificate for the direct movement of consignments of fisheries products by sea before the estimated time of arrival at the place of entry into the Union’s territory.

2. For the purposes of this Article only, “fisheries products” means all species of marine fish, molluscs and crustaceans.

##### Article FISH.12: Alignment of management areas
1. By 1 July 2021, the Parties shall request advice from ICES on the alignment of the management areas and the assessment units used by ICES for the stocks marked with an asterisk in Annex FISH.1.

2. Within six months of receipt of the advice referred to in paragraph 1, the Parties shall jointly review that advice and shall jointly consider adjustments to the management areas of the stocks concerned, with a view to agreeing consequential changes to the list of stocks and shares set out in Annex FISH.1.

##### Article FISH.13: Shares of TACs for certain other stocks
1. The Parties’ respective shares of the TACs for certain other stocks are set out in Annex FISH.2.

2. Each Party shall notify the relevant States and international organisations of its shares in accordance with the sharing arrangement set out in Annex FISH.2A to D.

3. Any subsequent changes to those shares in Annex FISH.2C and D are a matter for the relevant multilateral fora.

    (a) suspend, in whole or in part, access to its waters and the preferential tariff treatment granted to fishery products under Article GOODS.5[Prohibition of customs duties]; and
    (b) if it considers that the suspension referred to in point (a) is not commensurate to the economic and societal impact of the alleged failure, it may suspend, in whole or in part, the preferential tariff treatment of other goods under Article GOODS.5[Prohibition of customs duties]; and
    (c.) if it considers that the suspension referred to in points (a) and (b) is not commensurate to the economic and societal impact of the alleged failure, it may suspend, in whole or in part, obligations under Heading One [Trade] of Part Two [Economic Partnership] with the exception of Title XI [Level Playing Field for open and fair competition and sustainable development]. If Heading One [Trade] is suspended in whole, Heading Three [Road Transport] is also suspended.
