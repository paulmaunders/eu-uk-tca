(a) exemption to the applicable requirements;

(b) deviation from the applicable requirements; or

(c) compensating factors that provide an equivalent level of safety when applicable requirements

#### are not complied with.

3. In addition to the requirements set out in paragraphs 1 and 2, the validating authority shall
specify any special condition to be applied if the related airworthiness codes, laws, regulations and
administrative provisions do not contain adequate or appropriate safety requirements for the civil
aeronautical product, because:

(a) the civil aeronautical product has novel or unusual design features relative to the design
practices on which the applicable airworthiness codes, laws, regulations and administrative
provisions are based;

(b) the intended use of the civil aeronautical product is unconventional; or

(c) experience obtained from other, similar civil aeronautical products in service or civil
aeronautical products having similar design features has shown that unsafe conditions may

#### develop.

4. When specifying exemptions, deviations, compensating factors or special conditions, the
validating authority shall give due consideration to these applied by the certificating authority and
they shall not be more demanding for the civil aeronautical products to be validated than they
would be for its own similar products. The validating authority shall notify the certificating authority
of any such exemptions, deviations, compensating factors or special conditions.

 
Article 12: Level of involvement of the validating authority
 
1. The level of involvement of the validating authority of a Party during the validation process
referred to in Article 9 [Validation process] and as detailed in the technical implementation
procedures, shall be mainly determined by:

(a) the experience and records of the competent authority of the other Party as certificating
authority;

(b) the experience already gained by that validating authority during previous validation exercises
with the competent authority of the other Party;

(c) the nature of the design to be validated;

(d) the performance and experience of the applicant with the validating authority; and


(e) the outcome of qualification requirements assessments referred to in Articles 28
[Qualification requirements for the acceptance of findings of compliance and certificates] and
Article 29 [Continued qualifications of the competent authorities].

2. The validating authority shall exercise special procedures and scrutiny, in particular
regarding the certificating authority’s processes and methods, during the first validation of any
certificate, where the certificating authority has not previously issued a certificate in the category of
civil aeronautical products concerned after 30 September 2004. The procedures and criteria to be
applied shall be detailed in the technical implementation procedures.
3. The effective implementation of the principles set out in paragraphs 1 and 2 shall be
regularly measured, monitored, reviewed by the Certification Oversight Board, using metrics as
detailed in the technical implementation procedures.

 
Article 13: Acceptance
 
1 For a design certificate subject to acceptance, the validating authority shall accept the
design certificate issued by the certificating authority without any validation activities. In that case,
the design certificate shall be recognised by the validating authority as equivalent to a certificate
issued in accordance with laws, regulations and administrative provisions of its Party and the
validating authority shall not issue its corresponding certificate.

2. Non-significant supplemental type certificates, non-significant major changes and technical
standard order authorisations issued by the technical agent of the Union as certificating authority or
by an approved organisation under Union law shall be accepted by the technical agent of the United
Kingdom as validating authority.
3. Minor changes and repairs approved by the technical agent of the Union as certificating
authority or by an approved organisation under Union law shall be accepted by the technical agent
of the United Kingdom as validating authority.

certificating authority or by an approved organisation under laws and regulations of the United
Kingdom shall be accepted by the technical agent of the Union as validating authority.

 
Article 14: Implementation provisions for Articles 10 [Modalities of the validation of design
certificates] and 13 [Acceptance]
 
1. The minor change or major change classifications shall be made by the certificating authority
in accordance with the definitions set out in this Annex and interpreted in accordance with the
applicable rules and procedures of the certificating authority.
2. For classifying a supplemental type certificate or major change as significant or non-
significant, the certificating authority shall consider the change in the context of all previous relevant
design changes and all related revisions to the applicable certification specifications incorporated in
the type certificate for the civil aeronautical product. Changes that meet either of the following
criteria are automatically considered as significant:

(a) the general configuration or the principles of construction are not retained; or

(b) the assumptions used for certification of the product to be changed do not remain valid.


 
Article 15: Existing design certificates

SECTION G: Qualification of competent authorities
 
 
Article 28: Qualification requirements for the acceptance of findings of compliance and certificates
 
1. Each Party shall maintain a structured and effective certification and oversight system for
the implementation of this Annex, including:

(a) a legal and regulatory framework, ensuring in particular regulatory powers over entities
regulated under the regulatory system for civil aviation safety of the Party;

(b) an organisational structure, including a clear description of responsibilities;

(c) sufficient resources, including qualified staff with sufficient knowledge, experience and
training;

(d) adequate processes documented in policies and procedures;

(e) documentation and records; and

(f) an established inspection programme ensuring a uniform level of implementation of the legal

#### and regulatory framework among the various components of the oversight system.


 
Article 29: Continued qualifications of the competent authorities
 
1. In order to maintain mutual confidence in each Party's regulatory system concerning the
implementation of this Annex so that they ensure a sufficiently equivalent level of safety, the
technical agent of each Party shall regularly assess the other Party’s competent authorities’
compliance with the qualification requirements referred to in Article 28 [Qualification requirements
for the acceptance of findings of compliance and certificates]. The modalities of such continued
mutual assessments shall be detailed in the technical implementation procedures.
2. The competent authority of a Party shall cooperate with the competent authority of the
other Party whenever such assessments are required and ensure that regulated entities subject to
its oversight provide access to the technical agents of the Parties.
3. If the technical agent of either Party believes that the technical competence of a competent
authority of the other Party is no longer adequate, or that the acceptance of findings of compliance
made or certificates issued by that competent authority should be suspended as the other Party’s
systems concerning the implementation of this Annex no longer ensure a sufficiently equivalent level
of safety to permit such acceptance, the technical agents of the Parties shall consult in order to
identify remedial actions.
4. If mutual confidence is not restored through mutually acceptable means, the technical agent
of each Party may refer the matter referred to in paragraph 3 to the Certification Oversight Board.
5. If the matter is not resolved by the Certification Oversight Board, each Party may refer the
matter referred to in paragraph 3 to the Specialised Committee on Aviation Safety.

communications between the competent authorities of the Parties, including documentation as
detailed in the technical implementation procedures, shall be made in the English language.

 
Article 31: Technical consultations
 
1. The technical agents of the Parties shall address issues concerning the implementation of
this Annex through consultations.
2. If a mutually acceptable solution is not reached through consultations held pursuant to
paragraph 1, the technical agent of each Party may refer an issue as referred to in paragraph 1 to the
Certification Oversight Board.
3. If the issue is not resolved by the Certification Oversight Board, each Party may refer an
issue as referred to in paragraph 1 to the Specialised Committee on Aviation Safety.

in certification and continued airworthiness oversight activities related to design, production and


environmental protection certification. The support to be provided and the process for providing
such support shall be detailed in the technical implementation procedures.
