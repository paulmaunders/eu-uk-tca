The objective of this Title is to establish reciprocal cooperation between the competent law enforcement authorities of the United Kingdom, on the one side, and the Member States, on the other side, on the automated transfer of DNA profiles, dactyloscopic data and certain domestic vehicle registration data.

##### Article LAW.PRUM.6: Definitions
For the purposes of this Title, the following definitions apply:
    (a) “competent law enforcement authority” means a domestic police, customs or other authority that is authorised by domestic law to detect, prevent and investigate offences or criminal activities and to exercise authority and take coercive measures in the context of such activities; agencies, bodies or other units dealing especially with national security issues are not competent law enforcement authorities for the purposes of this Title;
    (b) “search” and “comparison”, as referred to in Articles LAW.PRUM.8 [Automated searching of DNA profiles], LAW.PRUM.9 [Automated comparison of DNA profiles], LAW.PRUM.12 [Automated searching of dactyloscopic data], and LAW.PRUM.17 [Implementing measures] mean the procedures by which it is established whether there is a match between, respectively, DNA data or dactyloscopic data which have been communicated by one State and DNA data or dactyloscopic data stored in the databases of one, several, or all of the other States;
    (c.) “automated searching”, as referred to in Article LAW.PRUM.15 [Automated searching of vehicle registration data], means an online access procedure for consulting the databases of one, several, or all of the other States;
    (d) “non-coding part of DNA” means chromosome regions not genetically expressed, i.e. not known to provide for any functional properties of an organism;
    (e) “DNA profile” means a letter or numeric code which represents a set of identification characteristics of the non-coding part of an analysed human DNA sample, i.e. the particular molecular structure at the various DNA locations (loci);
    (f) “DNA reference data” means DNA profile and reference number; DNA reference data shall only include DNA profiles established from the non-coding part of DNA and a reference number; DNA reference data shall not contain any data from which the data subject can be directly identified; DNA reference data which is not attributed to any natural person (unidentified DNA profiles) shall be recognisable as such;
    (g) “reference DNA profile” means the DNA profile of an identified person;
    (h) “unidentified DNA profile” means the DNA profile obtained from traces collected during the investigation of criminal offences and belonging to a person not yet identified;
    (i) “note” means a State's marking on a DNA profile in its domestic database indicating that there has already been a match for that DNA profile on another State's search or comparison;
    (j) “dactyloscopic data” means fingerprint images, images of fingerprint latents, palm prints, palm print latents and templates of such images (coded minutiae), when they are stored and dealt with in an automated database;
    (k) “dactyloscopic reference data” means dactyloscopic data and reference number; dactyloscopic reference data shall not contain any data from which the data subject can be directly identified; dactyloscopic reference data which is not attributed to any natural person (unidentified dactyloscopic data) shall be recognisable as such;
    (l) “vehicle registration data” means the data-set as specified in Chapter 3 of ANNEX LAW-1;
    (m) “individual case”, as referred to in Article LAW.PRUM.8(1) [Automated searching of DNA profiles], second sentence, Article LAW.PRUM.12(1) [Automated searching of dactyloscopic data], second sentence and Article LAW.PRUM.15(1) [Automated searching of vehicle registration data], means a single investigation or prosecution file; if such a file contains more than one DNA profile, or one piece of dactyloscopic data or vehicle registration data, they may be transmitted together as one request;
    (n) “laboratory activity” means any measure taken in a laboratory when locating and recovering traces on items, as well as developing, analysing and interpreting forensic evidence regarding DNA profiles and dactyloscopic data, with a view to providing expert opinions or exchanging forensic evidence;
    (o) “results of laboratory activities” means any analytical outputs and directly associated interpretation;
    (p.) “forensic service provider” means any organisation, public or private, that carries out laboratory activities at the request of competent law enforcement or judicial authorities;
    (q) “domestic accreditation body” means the sole body in a State that performs accreditation with authority derived from the State.

2. If an automated search shows that a DNA profile supplied matches DNA profiles entered in the requested State's searched file, the requested State shall send to the national contact point of the requesting State in an automated way the DNA reference data with which a match has been found. If no match can be found, this shall be notified automatically.

For the investigation of criminal offences, the States, via their national contact points, shall compare the DNA profiles of their unidentified DNA profiles with all DNA profiles from other domestic DNA analysis files' reference data in accordance with mutually accepted practical arrangements between the States concerned. DNA profiles shall be supplied and compared in automated form. Unidentified DNA profiles shall be supplied for comparison only where provided for under the requesting State's domestic law.

2. If a State, as a result of the comparison referred to in paragraph 1, finds that any DNA profiles supplied by another State match any of those in its DNA analysis files, it shall supply that other State's national contact point with the DNA reference data with which a match has been found without delay.

##### Article LAW.PRUM.10: Collection of cellular material and supply of DNA profiles
Where, in ongoing investigations or criminal proceedings, there is no DNA profile available for a particular individual present within a requested State's territory, the requested State shall provide legal assistance by collecting and examining cellular material from that individual and by supplying the DNA profile obtained to the requesting State, if:
    (a) the requesting State specifies the purpose for which it is required;
    (b) the requesting State produces an investigation warrant or statement issued by the competent authority, as required under that State's domestic law, showing that the requirements for collecting and examining cellular material would be fulfilled if the individual concerned were present within the requesting State's territory; and

The Specialised Committee on Law Enforcement and Judicial Cooperation may extend this period once by a maximum of nine months.

##### Article LAW.PRUM.19: Suspension and disapplication
1. In the event that the Union considers it necessary to amend this Title because Union law relating to the subject matter governed by this Title is amended substantially, or is in the process of being amended substantially, it may notify the United Kingdom accordingly with a view to agreeing on a formal amendment of this Agreement in relation to this Title. Following such notification, the Parties shall engage in consultations.

2. Where within nine months of that notification the Parties have not reached an agreement amending this Title, the Union may decide to suspend the application of this Title or any provisions of this Title for a period of up to nine months.

If by the end of the suspension period the Parties have not reached an agreement amending this Title, the suspended provisions shall cease to apply on the first day of the month following the expiry of the suspension period, unless the Union informs the United Kingdom that it no longer seeks any amendment to this Title. In that case, the suspended provisions of this Title shall be reinstated.

3. If any of the provisions of this Title are suspended under this Article, the Specialised Committee on Law Enforcement and Judicial Cooperation shall meet to decide what steps are needed to ensure that any cooperation initiated under this Title and affected by the suspension is concluded in an appropriate manner. In any event, with regard to all personal data obtained through cooperation under this Title before the provisions concerned by the suspension provisionally cease to apply, the Parties shall ensure that the level of protection under which the personal data were transferred is maintained after the suspension takes effect.
