##### ANNEX FISH.4: PROTOCOL ON ACCESS TO WATERS

The United Kingdom and the Union

AFFIRMING the sovereign rights and obligations of independent coastal States exercised by the
Parties;

EMPHASISING that the right of each Party to grant vessels of the other Party access to fish in its
waters is ordinarily to be exercised in annual consultations following the determination of TACs for a
given year in annual consultations;

NOTING the social and economic benefits of a further period of stability, during which fishers would
be permitted until 30 June 2026 to continue to access the waters of the other Party as before the
entry into force of this Agreement;

HAVE AGREED as follows:

 
Article 1
 
An adjustment period is hereby established. The adjustment period shall last from 1 January 2021
until 30 June 2026.

 
Article 2
 
1. By derogation from Article FISH.8(1), (3), (4), (5), (6) and (7) [Access to waters] of Heading V
[Fisheries], during the adjustment period each Party shall grant to vessels of the other Party full
access to its waters to fish:

(a) stocks listed in Annex FISH.1 and Annex FISH.2A, B and F at a level that is reasonably
commensurate with the Parties respective shares of the fishing opportunities;

(b) non quota stocks at a level that equates to the average tonnage fished by that Party in the
waters of the other Party during the period 2012-2016;

(c) for qualifying vessels to the zone in the waters of the Parties between six and twelve nautical
miles from the baselines in ICES divisions 4c and 7d-g to the extent that each Party’s qualifying
vessels had access to that zone on 31 December 2020.

For the purposes of this point, “qualifying vessel” means a vessel of a Party, which fished in the zone
mentioned in the previous sentence in at least four years between 2012 and 2016, or its direct
replacement.

2. The Parties shall notify the other Party of any change in the level and conditions of access to
waters that will apply from 1 July 2026.
3. Article 9[Compensatory measures in case of withdrawal or reduction of access] shall apply
_mutatis_ mutandis in relation to any change under paragraph 2 of this Article in respect of the period
from 1 July 2026 to 31 December 2026.
