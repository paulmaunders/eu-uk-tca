6. For the purposes of the Schedules of the United Kingdom and the Union, a reservation for a
requirement to have a local presence in the territory of the Union or the United Kingdom is taken
against Article SERVIN 3.3 [Local presence], and not against Article SERVIN 3.2 [Market access] or
SERVIN 3.4 [National treatment]. Furthermore, such a requirement is not taken as a reservation
against Article SERVIN 2.3 [National treatment].

measure of a Member State at the central level or to a measure of a government within a Member
State, unless the reservation excludes a Member State. A reservation taken by a Member State
applies to a measure of a government at the central, regional or local level within that Member

to fulfil a membership requirement of a particular profession, such as membership in a professional
organisation, to have a local agent for service, or to maintain a local address, or any other non-
discriminatory requirements that certain activities may not be carried out in protected zones or
areas. While not listed, such measures continue to apply.
9. For greater certainty, for the European Union, the obligation to grant national treatment
does not entail the requirement to extend to natural or legal persons of the United Kingdom the
treatment granted in a Member State, pursuant to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European
Union, or any measure adopted pursuant to that Treaty, including their implementation in the
Member States, to:

 
(i) natural persons or residents of another Member State; or
 
 
(ii) legal persons constituted or organised under the law of another Member State or of the

the law of the other Party (including, in the case of the Union, the law of a Member State) and
having their registered office, central administration or principal place of business within that other
Party, is without prejudice to any condition or obligation, consistent with Chapter 2 [Investment
Liberalisation] of Title II [Services and Investment] of Heading One [Trade] of Part Two [Trade,
transport and fisheries], which may have been imposed on such legal person when it was
established in that other Party, and which shall continue to apply.
11. The schedules apply only to the territories of the United Kingdom and the European Union in
accordance with Article FINPROV.1 [Territorial Scope] and Article OTH.9.2 [Geographical Scope] and
are only relevant in the context of trade relations between the Union and its Member States with
the United Kingdom. They do not affect the rights and obligations of the Member States under
Union law.
12. For greater certainty, non-discriminatory measures do not constitute a market access
limitation within the meaning of Articles SERVIN. 2.2 [Market access – Investment liberalisation], or
SERVIN.3.2 [Market access – Cross-border trade in services] or Article SERVIN.5.49 [Obligations –
Legal services] for any measure:

 
(a) requiring the separation of the ownership of infrastructure from the ownership of the
goods or services provided through that infrastructure to ensure fair competition, for
example in the fields of energy, transportation and telecommunications;
 
 
(b) restricting the concentration of ownership to ensure fair competition;
 
 
(c) seeking to ensure the conservation and protection of natural resources and the
environment, including a limitation on the availability, number and scope of concessions
granted, and the imposition of a moratorium or ban;

constraints, for example telecommunications spectra and frequencies; or
 
 
(e) requiring that a certain percentage of the shareholders, owners, partners, or directors of
an enterprise be qualified or practice a certain profession such as lawyers or
accountants.
 
13. With respect to financial services: Unlike foreign subsidiaries, branches established directly
in a Member State by a non-European Union financial institution are not, with certain limited
exceptions, subject to prudential regulations harmonised at European Union level which enable such
subsidiaries to benefit from enhanced facilities to set up new establishments and to provide cross-
border services throughout the Union. Therefore, such branches receive an authorisation to operate
in the territory of a Member State under conditions equivalent to those applied to domestic financial
institutions of that Member State, and may be required to satisfy a number of specific prudential
requirements such as, in the case of banking and securities, separate capitalisation and other
solvency requirements and reporting and publication of accounts requirements or, in the case of
insurance, specific guarantee and deposit requirements, a separate capitalisation, and the
localisation in the Member State concerned of the assets representing the technical reserves and at
least one third of the solvency margin.
