### Section 3 – Review of Product-Specific rules for Heading 8507

1. Not earlier than 4 years from the entry into force of this Agreement, the Trade Partnership Committee shall, on request of either Party and assisted by the Trade Specialised Committee on Customs Cooperation and Rules of Origin, review the product-specific rules for heading 8507 applicable as from 1 January 2027, contained in Annex ORIG-2 [Product-Specific Rules of Origin].

2. The review referred to in paragraph 1, shall be made on the basis of available information about the markets within the Parties, such as the availability of sufficient and suitable originating materials, the balance between supply and demand and other relevant information.

3. On the basis of the results of the review carried out pursuant to paragraph 1, the Partnership Council may adopt a decision to amend the product-specific rules for heading 8507 applicable as from 1 January 2027, contained in Annex ORIG-2 [Product-Specific Rules of Origin].
