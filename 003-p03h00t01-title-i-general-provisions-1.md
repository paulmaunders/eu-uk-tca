##### Article LAW.GEN.3: Protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms

The cooperation provided for in this Part is based on the Parties’ and Member States’ long-standing respect for democracy, the rule of law and the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals, including as set out in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in the European Convention on Human Rights, and on the importance of giving effect to the rights and freedoms in that Convention domestically.

2. Nothing in this Part modifies the obligation to respect fundamental rights and legal principles as reflected, in particular, in the European Convention on Human Rights and, in the case of the Union and its Member States, in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.

##### Article LAW.GEN.4: Protection of personal data
8. The cooperation provided for in this Part is based on the Parties’ long-standing commitment to ensuring a high level of protection of personal data.

9. To reflect that high level of protection, the Parties shall ensure that personal data processed under this Part is subject to effective safeguards in the Parties’ respective data protection regimes, including that:
    (a) personal data is processed lawfully and fairly in compliance with the principles of data minimisation, purpose limitation, accuracy and storage limitation;
    (b) processing of special categories of personal data is only permitted to the extent necessary and subject to appropriate safeguards adapted to the specific risks of the processing;
    (c.) a level of security appropriate to the risk of the processing is ensured through relevant technical and organisational measures, in particular as regards the processing of special categories of personal data;
    (d) data subjects are granted enforceable rights of access, rectification and erasure, subject to possible restrictions provided for by law which constitute necessary and proportionate measures in a democratic society to protect important objectives of public interest;
    (e) in the event of a data breach creating a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the competent supervisory authority is notified without undue delay of the breach; where the breach is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the data subjects are also notified, subject to possible restrictions provided for by law which constitute necessary and proportionate measures in a democratic society to protect important objectives of public interest;
    (f) onward transfers to a third country are allowed only subject to conditions and safeguards appropriate to the transfer ensuring that the level of protection is not undermined;

The United Kingdom, on the one side, and the Union, also on behalf of any of its Member States, on the other side, shall notify the Specialised Committee on Law Enforcement and Judicial Cooperation of the supervisory authorities responsible for overseeing the implementation of, and ensuring compliance with, data protection rules applicable to cooperation under this Part. The supervisory authorities shall cooperate to ensure compliance with this Part.

11. The provisions on the protection of personal data set out in this Part apply to the processing of personal data wholly or partly by automated means, and to the processing other than by automated means of personal data which form part of a filing system or are intended to form part of a filing system.

12. This Article is without prejudice to the application of any specific provisions in this Part relating to the processing of personal data.

##### Article LAW.GEN.5: Scope of cooperation where a Member State no longer participates in analogous measures under Union law
1. This Article applies if a Member State ceases to participate in, or enjoy rights under, provisions of Union law relating to law enforcement and judicial cooperation in criminal matters analogous to any of the relevant provisions of this Part.

2. The United Kingdom may notify the Union in writing of its intention to cease to operate the relevant provisions of this Part in relation to that Member State.

3. A notification given under paragraph 2 takes effect on the date specified therein, which shall be no earlier than the date on which the Member State ceases to participate in, or to enjoy rights under, the provisions of Union law referred to in paragraph 1.

4. If the United Kingdom gives notification under this Article of its intention to cease to apply the relevant provisions of this Part, the Specialised Committee on Law Enforcement and Judicial Cooperation shall meet to decide what measures are needed to ensure that any cooperation initiated under this Part that is affected by the cessation is concluded in an appropriate manner. In any event, with regard to all personal data obtained through cooperation under the relevant provisions of this Part before they cease to be applied, the Parties shall ensure that the level of protection under which the personal data were transferred is maintained after the cessation takes effect.

5. The Union shall notify the United Kingdom in writing, through diplomatic channels, of the date on which the Member State is to resume its participation in, or the enjoyment of rights under, the provisions of Union law in question. The application of the relevant provisions of this Part shall be reinstated on that date or, if later, on the first day of the month following the day on which that notification has been given.

6. To facilitate the application of this Article, the Union shall inform the United Kingdom when a Member State ceases to participate in, or enjoy rights under, provisions of Union law relating to law enforcement and judicial cooperation in criminal matters analogous to the relevant provisions of this Part.
