    (a) are promoted, advertised or marketed for the purpose of circumvention of;
    (b) have only a limited commercially significant purpose or use other than to circumvent; or
    (c.) are primarily designed, produced, adapted or performed for the purpose of enabling or facilitating the circumvention of, any effective technological measures.

3. For the purposes of this Section, the expression "technological measures" means any technology, device or component that, in the normal course of its operation, is designed to prevent or restrict acts, in respect of works or other subject-matter, which are not authorised by the right holder of any copyright or related right covered by this Section. Technological measures shall be deemed "effective" where the use of a protected work or other subject matter is controlled by the right holders through application of an access control or protection process, such as encryption, scrambling or other transformation of the work or other subject-matter or a copy control mechanism, which achieves the protection objective.

4. Notwithstanding the legal protection provided for in paragraph 1 of this Article, each Party may take appropriate measures, as necessary, to ensure that the adequate legal protection against the circumvention of effective technological measures provided for in accordance with this Article does not prevent beneficiaries of exceptions or limitations provided for in accordance with Article IP.15 [Exceptions and limitations] from enjoying such exceptions or limitations.

A trade mark may consist of any signs, in particular words, including personal names, or designs, letters, numerals, colours, the shape of goods or of the packaging of goods, or sounds, provided that such signs are capable of:
    (a) distinguishing the goods or services of one undertaking from those of other undertakings; and
    (b) being represented on the respective trade mark register of each Party, in a manner which enables the competent authorities and the public to determine the clear and precise subject matter of the protection afforded to its proprietor.

##### Article IP.20: Rights conferred by a trade mark
1. Each Party shall provide that the registration of a trade mark confers on the proprietor exclusive rights therein. The proprietor shall be entitled to prevent all third parties not having the proprietorâ€™s consent from using in the course of trade:
    (a) any sign which is identical with the registered trade mark in relation to goods or services which are identical with those for which the trade mark is registered;
    (b) any sign where, because of its identity with, or similarity to, the registered trade mark and the identity or similarity of the goods or services covered by this trade mark and the sign, there exists a likelihood of confusion on the part of the public, including the likelihood of association between the sign and the registered trade mark.

2. The proprietor of a registered trade mark shall be entitled to prevent all third parties from bringing goods, in the course of trade, into the Party where the trade mark is registered without being released for free circulation there, where such goods, including packaging, come from other countries or the other Party and bear without authorisation a trade mark which is identical to the trade mark registered in respect of such goods, or which cannot be distinguished in its essential aspects from that trade mark.

3. The entitlement of the proprietor of a trade mark pursuant to paragraph 2 shall lapse if during the proceedings to determine whether the registered trade mark has been infringed, evidence is provided by the declarant or the holder of the goods that the proprietor of the registered trade mark is not entitled to prohibit the placing of the goods on the market in the country of final destination.

##### Article IP.21: Registration procedure

##### Article IP.23: Exceptions to the rights conferred by a trade mark
1. Each Party shall provide for limited exceptions to the rights conferred by a trade mark such as the fair use of descriptive terms including geographical indications, and may provide other limited exceptions, provided such exceptions take account of the legitimate interests of the proprietor of the trade mark and of third parties.

2. The trade mark shall not entitle the proprietor to prohibit a third party from using, in the course of trade:
    (a) the name or address of the third party, where the third party is a natural person;
    (b) signs or indications concerning the kind, quality, quantity, intended purpose, value, geographical origin, the time of production of goods or of rendering of the service, or other characteristics of goods or services; or
    (c.) the trade mark for the purpose of identifying or referring to goods or services as those of the proprietor of that trade mark, in particular where the use of that trade mark is necessary to indicate the intended purpose of a product or service, in particular as accessories or spare parts,
provided the third party uses them in accordance with honest practices in industrial or commercial matters.

3. The trade mark shall not entitle the proprietor to prohibit a third party from using, in the course of trade, an earlier right which only applies in a particular locality if that right is recognised by the laws of the Party in question and is used within the limits of the territory in which it is recognised.

##### Article IP.24: Grounds for revocation
1. Each Party shall provide that a trade mark shall be liable to revocation if, within a continuous period of five years it has not been put to genuine use in the relevant territory of a Party by the proprietor or with the proprietorâ€™s consent in relation to the goods or services for which it is registered, and there are no proper reasons for non-use.

2. Each Party shall also provide that a trade mark shall be liable to revocation if within the period of five years following the date of completion of the registration procedure it has not been put to genuine use in the relevant territory by the proprietor or with the proprietorâ€™s consent, in relation to the goods or services for which it is registered, and there are no proper reasons for non-use.

3. However, no person may claim that the proprietor's rights in a trade mark should be revoked where, during the interval between expiry of the five-year period and filing of the application for revocation, genuine use of the trade mark has been started or resumed. The commencement or resumption of use within a period of three months preceding the filing of the application for revocation which began at the earliest on expiry of the continuous period of five years of non-use, shall, however, be disregarded where preparations for the commencement or resumption occur only after the proprietor becomes aware that the application for revocation may be filed.

4. A trade mark shall also be liable to revocation if, after the date on which it was registered:
    (a) as a consequence of acts or inactivity of the proprietor, it has become the common name in the trade for a good or service in respect of which it is registered;
    (b) as a consequence of the use made of the trade mark by the proprietor of the trade mark or with the proprietor's consent in respect of the goods or services for which it is registered, it is liable to mislead the public, particularly as to the nature, quality or geographical origin of those goods or services.

##### Article IP.25: The right to prohibit preparatory acts in relation to the use of packaging or other means
Where the risk exists that the packaging, labels, tags, security or authenticity features or devices, or any other means to which the trade mark is affixed could be used in relation to goods or services and that use would constitute an infringement of the rights of the proprietor of the trade mark, the proprietor of that trade mark shall have the right to prohibit the following acts if carried out in the course of trade:
    (a) affixing a sign identical with, or similar to, the trade mark on packaging, labels, tags, security or authenticity features or devices, or any other means to which the mark may be affixed; or
    (b) offering or placing on the market, or stocking for those purposes, or importing or exporting, packaging, labels, tags, security or authenticity features or devices, or any other means to which the mark is affixed.

##### Article IP.26: Bad faith applications
A trade mark shall be liable to be declared invalid where the application for registration of the trade mark was made in bad faith by the applicant. Each Party may provide that such a trade mark shall not be registered.

#### Section 3: Design
##### Article IP.27: Protection of registered designs
1. Each Party shall provide for the protection of independently created designs that are new and original. This protection shall be provided by registration and shall confer exclusive rights upon their holders in accordance with this Section.
For the purposes of this Article, a Party may consider that a design having individual character is original.

2. The holder of a registered design shall have the right to prevent third parties not having the holder's consent at least from making, offering for sale, selling, importing, exporting, stocking the product bearing and embodying the protected design or using articles bearing or embodying the protected design where such acts are undertaken for commercial purposes.

3. A design applied to or incorporated in a product which constitutes a component part of a complex product shall only be considered to be new and original:
    (a) if the component part, once it has been incorporated into the complex product, remains visible during normal use of the latter; and
    (b) to the extent that those visible features of the component part fulfil in themselves the requirements as to novelty and originality.

4. For the purposes of point (a) of paragraph 3, "normal use" means use by the end user, excluding maintenance, servicing or repair work.

##### Article IP.28: Duration of protection
The duration of protection available for registered designs, including renewals of registered designs, shall amount to a total term of 25 years from the date on which the application was filed^36.

##### Article IP.29: Protection of unregistered designs
1. Each Party shall confer on holders of an unregistered design the right to prevent the use of the unregistered design by any third party not having the holderâ€™s consent only if the contested use results from copying the unregistered design in their respective territory37. Such use shall at least cover the offering for sale, putting on the market, importing or exporting the product.

2. The duration of protection available for the unregistered design shall amount to at least three years as from the date on which the design was first made available to the public in the territory of the respective Party.

##### Article IP.30: Exceptions and exclusions
1. Each Party may provide limited exceptions to the protection of designs, including unregistered designs, provided that such exceptions do not unreasonably conflict with the normal exploitation of designs, and do not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the holder of the design, taking account of the legitimate interests of third parties.

2. Protection shall not extend to designs solely dictated by technical or functional considerations. A design shall not subsist in features of appearance of a product which must necessarily be reproduced in their exact form and dimensions in order to permit the product in which the design is incorporated or to which it is applied to be mechanically connected to or placed in, around or against another product so that either product may perform its function.

3. By way of derogation from paragraph 2, a design shall, in accordance with the conditions set out in Article IP.27(1) [Protection of registered designs], subsist in a design, which has the purpose of allowing the multiple assembly or connection of mutually interchangeable products within a modular system.

##### Article IP.31: Relationship to copyright
Each Party shall ensure that designs, including unregistered designs, shall also be eligible for protection under the copyright law of that Party as from the date on which the design was created or fixed in any form. The extent to which, and the conditions under which, such a protection is conferred, including the level of originality required, shall be determined by each Party.

#### Section 4: Patents
(^36) Each Party may determine the relevant date of filing of the application in accordance with its own legislation.
(^37) This section does not apply to the protection known in the United Kingdom as a design right.

##### Article IP.32: Patents and public health
1. The Parties recognise the importance of the Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health, adopted on 14 November 2001 by the Ministerial Conference of the WTO at Doha (the "Doha Declaration"). In interpreting and implementing the rights and obligations under this Section, each Party shall ensure consistency with the Doha Declaration.

2. Each Party shall implement Article 31bis of the TRIPS Agreement, as well as the Annex to the TRIPS Agreement and the Appendix to the Annex to the TRIPS Agreement.

##### Article IP.33: Extension of the period of protection conferred by a patent on medicinal products and on plant protection products
1. The Parties recognise that medicinal products and plant protection products38 protected by a patent in their respective territory may be subject to an administrative authorisation procedure before being put on their respective markets. The Parties recognise that the period that elapses between the filing of the application for a patent and the first authorisation to place the product on the market, as defined for that purpose by the relevant legislation, may shorten the period of effective protection under the patent.

2. Each Party shall provide for further protection, in accordance with its laws and regulations, for a product which is protected by a patent and which has been subject to an administrative authorisation procedure referred to in paragraph 1 to compensate the holder of a patent for the reduction of effective patent protection. The terms and conditions for the provision of such further protection, including its length, shall be determined in accordance with the laws and regulations of the Parties.

3. For the purposes of this Title, "medicinal product" means:
    (a) any substance or combination of substances presented as having properties for treating or preventing disease in human beings or animals; or

2. For the purposes of this Section:
    (a) "trade secret" means information which meets all of the following requirements:
(^38) For the purposes of this Title, the term "plant protection product" shall be defined for each Party by the respective legislations of the Parties.
        (i) it is secret in the sense that it is not, as a body or in the precise configuration and assembly of its components, generally known among or readily accessible to persons within the circles that normally deal with the kind of information in question;
        (ii) it has commercial value because it is secret; and
        (iii) it has been subject to reasonable steps under the circumstances, by the person lawfully in control of the information, to keep it secret;   
    (b) "trade secret holder" means any natural or legal person lawfully controlling a trade secret.

    (a) the acquisition of a trade secret without the consent of the trade secret holder, whenever obtained by unauthorised access to, or by appropriation or copying of, any documents, objects, materials, substances or electronic files that are lawfully under the control of the trade secret holder, and that contain the trade secret or from which the trade secret can be deduced;
    (b) the use or disclosure of a trade secret whenever it is carried out, without the consent of the trade secret holder, by a person who is found to meet any of the following conditions:

Each Party may provide that the judicial authorities, in appropriate cases and at the request of the person liable to be subject to the measures provided for in Article IP.44 [Corrective measures] or Article IP.45 [Injunctions], may order pecuniary compensation to be paid to the injured party instead of applying the measures provided for in these two Articles if that person acted unintentionally and without negligence, if execution of the measures in question would cause the person disproportionate harm and if pecuniary compensation to the injured party appears reasonably satisfactory.

##### Article IP.47: Damages
1. Each Party shall ensure that its judicial authorities, on application of the injured party, order the infringer who knowingly engaged, or had reasonable grounds to know it was engaging, in an infringing activity, to pay to the rightholder damages appropriate to the actual prejudice suffered by the rightholder as a result of the infringement.

2. Each Party shall ensure that when its judicial authorities set the damages:
    (a) they take into account all appropriate aspects, such as the negative economic consequences, including lost profits, which the injured party has suffered, any unfair profits made by the infringer and, in appropriate cases, elements other than economic factors, such as the moral prejudice caused to the right holder by the infringement; or
    (b) as an alternative to point (a), they may, in appropriate cases, set the damages as a lump sum on the basis of elements such as at least the amount of royalties or fees which would have been due if the infringer had requested authorisation to use the intellectual property right in question.

3. Where the infringer did not knowingly, or with reasonable grounds to know, engage in infringing activity, each Party may lay down that the judicial authorities may order the recovery of profits or the payment of damages which may be pre-established.
