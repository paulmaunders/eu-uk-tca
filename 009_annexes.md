## ANNEX ORIG-1: INTRODUCTORY NOTES TO PRODUCT-SPECIFIC RULES OF ORIGIN

### Note 1

#### General Principles

1. This Annex sets out the general rules for the applicable requirements of Annex ORIG-2 [Product-specific rules of origin] as provided for in point (c) of Article ORIG 3(1) [General requirements] of this Agreement.

2. For the purposes of this Annex and Annex ORIG-2 [Product-specific rules of origin], the requirements for a product to be originating in accordance with point (c) of Article ORIG.3(1) [General Requirements] of this Agreement are a change in tariff classification, a production process, a maximum value or weight of non-originating materials, or any other requirement specified in this Annex and Annex ORIG-2 [Product-specific rules of origin].

3. Reference to weight in a product-specific rule of origin means the net weight, which is the weight of a material or a product, not including the weight of any packaging.

4. This Annex and Annex ORIG-2 [Product-specific rules of origin] are based on the Harmonised System, as amended on 1 January 2017.

### Note 2

#### The Structure of the List of Product-specific Rules of Origin

1. Notes on sections or chapters, where applicable, are read in conjunction with the product-specific rules of origin for the relevant section, chapter, heading or subheading.

2. Each product-specific rule of origin set out in Column 2 of Annex ORIG-2 [Product-specific rules of origin] applies to the corresponding product indicated in Column 1 of Annex ORIG-2 [Product-specific rules of origin].

3. If a product is subject to alternative product-specific rules of origin, the product shall be originating in a Party if it satisfies one of the alternatives.

4. If a product is subject to a product-specific rule of origin that includes multiple requirements, the product shall be originating in a Party only if it satisfies all of the requirements.

5. For the purposes of this Annex and Annex ORIG-2 [Product-specific rules of origin], the following definitions apply:
    (a) ‘section’ means a section of the Harmonised System;
    (b) ‘Chapter’ means the first two-digits in the tariff classification number under the Harmonised System;
    (c.) ‘heading’ means the first four-digits in the tariff classification number under the Harmonised System; and
    (d) ‘subheading’ means the first six-digits in the tariff classification number under the Harmonised System.

2. For the purposes of the product-specific rules of origin, the following abbreviations apply:
‘CC’ means production from non-originating materials of any Chapter, except that of the product; this means that any non-originating material used in the production of the product must be classified in a Chapter (2-digit level of the Harmonised System) other than that of the product (i.e. a change in Chapter);

‘CTH’ means production from non-originating materials of any heading, except that of the product; this means that any non-originating material used in the production of the product must be classified in a heading (4-digit level of the Harmonised System) other than that of the product (i.e. a change in heading);

‘CTSH’ means production from non-originating materials of any subheading, except that of the product; this means that any non-originating material used in the production of the product must be classified in a subheading (6-digit level of the Harmonised System) other than that of the product (i.e. a change in sub-heading).

### Note 3

#### Application of the Product-specific Rules of Origin

1. Article ORIG.3(2) [General requirements] of this Agreement, concerning products having acquired originating status which are used in the production of other products, applies whether or not this status has been acquired inside the same factory in a Party where these products are used.

2. If a product-specific rule of origin specifically excludes certain non-originating material or provides that the value or weight of a specified non-originating material shall not exceed a specific threshold, these conditions do not apply to non-originating materials classified elsewhere in the Harmonised System.

3. Example 1: when the rule for bulldozers (HS sub-heading 8429.11) requires: “CTH except from non-originating materials of heading 84.31 parts suitable solely for machinery of heading 84.25 to 84.30”, the use of non-originating materials classified elsewhere than 84.29 and 84.31- such as screws (HS heading 73.18), insulated wires and electric conductors (HS heading 85.44) and various electronics (HS Chapter 85) - is not limited.

Example 2: When the rule for heading 35.05 (dextrins and other modified starches; glues based on starches etc) requires ‘CTH except from non-originating heading 11.08’ then the use of non-originating materials classified elsewhere than 11.08 (starches, inulin), such as materials of Chapter 10 (cereals), is not limited.

4. If a product-specific rule of origin provides that a product shall be produced from a particular material, this does not prevent the use of other materials which are unable to satisfy that rule because of their inherent nature.

### Note 4

#### Calculation of a maximum value of non-originating materials

For the purposes of the product-specific rules of origin, the following definitions apply:
    (a) "customs value" means the value as determined in accordance with the Agreement on Implementation of Article VII of GATT 1994;
    (b) "EXW" or "ex-works price" means:
        (i) the price of the product paid or payable to the producer in whose undertaking the last working or processing is carried out, provided that the price includes the value of all the materials used and all other costs incurred in the production of the product, minus any internal taxes which are, or may be, repaid when the product obtained is exported; or
        (ii) if there is no price paid or payable or if the actual price paid does not reflect all costs related to the production of the product which are actually incurred in the production of the product, the value of all the materials used and all other costs incurred in the production of the product in the exporting Party:
            (A) including selling, general and administrative expenses, as well as profit, that can reasonably be allocated to the product; and
            (B) excluding the cost of freight, insurance, all other costs incurred in transporting the product and any internal taxes of the exporting Party which are, or may be, repaid when the product obtained is exported.
        (iii) For the purposes of point (i), where the last production has been contracted to a producer, the term ‘producer’ in point (i) refers to the person who has employed the subcontractor.
    (c.) "MaxNOM" means the maximum value of non-originating materials expressed as a percentage and shall be calculated according to the following formula:
        
        MaxNOM (%) = (VNM / EXW) × 100

(d) "VNM" means the value of the non-originating materials used in the production of the product, which is its customs value at the time of importation, including freight, insurance if appropriate, packing and all other costs incurred in transporting the materials to the importation port in the Party where the producer of the product is located; where the value of the non-originating materials is not known and cannot be ascertained, the first ascertainable price paid for the non-originating materials in the Union or in the United Kingdom is used; the value of the non-originating materials used in the production of the product may be calculated on the basis of the weighted average value formula or other inventory valuation method under accounting principles which are generally accepted in the Party.

### Note 5

#### Definitions of processes referred to in Sections V to VII in Annex ORIG-2 [Product-specific rules of origin]

For the purposes of product-specific rules of origin, the following definitions apply:
    (a) ‘biotechnological processing’ means:

        (ii) production, isolation or purification of cellular or intercellular structures (such as isolated genes, gene fragments and plasmids), or fermentation;
    (b) ‘change in particle size’ means the deliberate and controlled modification in particle size of a product, other than by merely crushing or pressing, resulting in a product with a defined particle size, defined particle size distribution or defined surface area, which is relevant to the purposes of the resulting product and with physical or chemical characteristics different from those of the input materials;
    (c.) ‘chemical reaction’ means a process (including a biochemical processing) which results in a molecule with a new structure by breaking intramolecular bonds and by forming new intramolecular bonds, or by altering the spatial arrangement of atoms in a molecule, with the exception of the following, which are not considered to be chemical reactions for the purpose of this definition:
        (i) dissolving in water or other solvents;
        (ii) the elimination of solvents including solvent water; or
        (iii) the addition or elimination of water of crystallisation;
    (d) ‘distillation’ means:
        (i) atmospheric distillation: a separation process in which petroleum oils are converted, in a distillation tower, into fractions according to boiling point and the vapour then condensed into different liquefied fractions; products produced from petroleum distillation may include liquefied petroleum gas, naphtha, gasoline, kerosene, diesel or heating oil, light gas oils and lubricating oil; and
        (ii) vacuum distillation: distillation at a pressure below atmospheric but not so low that it would be classed as molecular distillation; vacuum distillation is used for distilling high-boiling and heat-sensitive materials such as heavy distillates in petroleum oils to produce light to heavy vacuum gas oils and residuum;
    (e) ‘isomer separation’ means the isolation or separation of isomers from a mixture of isomers;
    (f) ‘mixing and blending’ means the deliberate and proportionally controlled mixing or blending (including dispersing) of materials, other than the addition of diluents, only to conform to predetermined specifications which results in the production of a product having physical or chemical characteristics that are relevant to the purposes or uses of the product and are different from the input materials;
    (g) ‘production of standard materials’ (including standard solutions) means a production of a preparation suitable for analytical, calibrating or referencing uses with precise degrees of purity or proportions certified by the producer; and
    (h) ‘purification’ means a process which results in the elimination of at least 80 % of the content of existing impurities or the reduction or elimination of impurities resulting in a good suitable for one or more of the following applications:
        (i) pharmaceutical, medical, cosmetic, veterinary or food grade substances;
        (ii) chemical products and reagents for analytical, diagnostic or laboratory uses;

    (d) ‘printing (as standalone operation)’ means a technique by which an objectively assessed function, such as colour, design, or technical performance, is given to a textile substrate with a permanent character, using screen, roller, digital or transfer techniques combined with at least two preparatory or finishing operations (such as scouring, bleaching, mercerizing, heat setting, raising, calendaring, shrink resistance processing, permanent finishing, decatising, impregnating, mending and burling, shearing, singeing, process of air-tumbler, process of stenter, milling, steam and shrinking, and wet decatising), provided that the value of all the non-originating materials used does not exceed 50 % of the EXW of the product.

### Note 7

#### Tolerances applicable to products containing two or more basic textile materials

1. For the purposes of this Note, basic textile materials are the following:
    (a) silk;
    (b) wool;
    (c.) coarse animal hair;
    (d) fine animal hair;
    (e) horsehair;
    (f) cotton;

    (s) synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyacrylonitrile;  
    (t) synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyimide;
    (u) synthetic man-made staple fibres of polytetrafluoroethylene;
    (v) synthetic man-made staple fibres of poly (phenylene sulphide);
    (w) synthetic man-made staple fibres of poly (vinyl chloride);
    (x) other synthetic man-made staple fibres;
    (y) artificial man-made staple fibres of viscose;
    (z) other artificial man-made staple fibres;
    (aa) yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyether, whether or not gimped;
    (bb) yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyester whether or not gimped;
    (cc) products of heading 56.05 (metallised yarn) incorporating strip consisting of a core of aluminium foil or of a core of plastic film irrespective of whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a width not exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of a transparent or coloured adhesive between two layers of plastic film;
    (dd) other products of heading 56.05;
    (ee) glass fibres; and
    (ff) metal fibres.

2. Where reference to this Note is made in Annex ORIG-2 [Product-specific rules of origin], the requirements set out in its Column 2 shall not apply, as a tolerance, to non-originating basic textile materials which are used in the production of a product, provided that:
    (a) the product contains two or more basic textile materials; and
    (b) the weight of the non-originating basic textile materials, taken together, does not exceed 10 % of the total weight of all the basic textile materials used.

    Example: For a woollen fabric of heading 51.12 containing woollen yarn of heading 51.07, synthetic yarn of staple fibres of heading 55.09 and materials other than basic textile materials, non-originating woollen yarn which does not satisfy the requirement set out in Annex ORIG-2 [Product-specific rules of origin], or non-originating synthetic yarn which does not satisfy the requirement set out in Annex ORIG-2 [Product-specific rules of origin], or a combination of both, may be used, provided that their total weight does not exceed 10 % of the weight of all the basic textile materials.

3. Notwithstanding Note 7.2 (b), for products containing ‘yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyether, whether or not gimped’, the maximum tolerance is 20 %. However, the percentage of the other non-originating basic textile materials shall not exceed 10 %.

4. Notwithstanding Note 7.2 (b), for products containing ‘strip consisting of a core of aluminium foil or of a core of plastic film irrespective of whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a width not exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of a transparent or coloured adhesive between two layers of plastic film, the maximum tolerance is 30 %. However, the percentage of the other non-originating basic textile materials shall not exceed 10 %.

### Note 8

#### Other tolerances applicable to certain textile products

1. Where reference to this Note is made in Annex ORIG-2 [Product-specific rules of Origin], non-originating textile materials (with the exception of linings and interlinings) which do not satisfy the requirements set out in its Column 2 for a made-up textile product may be used, provided that they are classified in a heading other than that of the product and that their value does not exceed 8 % of the EXW of the product.

2. Non-originating materials which are not classified in Chapters 50 to 63 may be used without restriction in the production of textile products classified in Chapters 50 to 63, whether or not they contain textiles.

    Example: If a requirement set out in Annex ORIG-2 [Product-specific rules of origin] provides that yarn shall be used, for a certain textile item (such as trousers), this does not prevent the use of non-originating metal items (such as buttons), because metal items are not classified in Chapters 50 to 63. For the same reasons, it does not prevent the use of non-originating slide fasteners, even though slide-fasteners normally contain textiles.

3. Where a requirement set out in Annex ORIG-2 [Product-specific rules of origin] consists in a maximum value of non-originating materials, the value of the non-originating materials which are not classified in Chapters 50 to 63 shall be taken into account in the calculation of the value of the non-originating materials.

### Note 9

#### Agricultural Products

Agricultural products classified under Section II of the Harmonised System and heading 24.01, which are grown or harvested in the territory of a Party, shall be treated as originating in the territory of that Party, even if grown from seeds, bulbs, rootstock, cuttings, slips, grafts, shoots, buds, or other live parts of plants imported from a third country.

(1) Where the invoice or other document to which the declaration is annexed relates to different kinds of products, or to products which do not incorporate non-originating materials to the same extent, the supplier must clearly differentiate them.

(2) The information requested does not have to be given unless it is necessary.

__Examples:__
One of the rules for garments of Chapter 62 provides “Weaving combined with making-up including cutting of fabric”. If a manufacturer of such garments in a Party uses fabric imported from the other Party which has been obtained there by weaving non-originating yarn, it is sufficient for the supplier in the latter Party to describe in his declaration the non-originating material used as yarn, without it being necessary to indicate the HS heading and the value of such yarn.

A producer of wire of iron of HS heading 7217 who has produced it from non-originating iron bars should indicate in the second column 'bars of iron'. Where that wire is to be used in the production of a machine for which the rule contains a limitation for all non-originating materials used to a certain percentage value, it is necessary to indicate in the third column the value of non-originating bars.

(3) ‘Value of non-originating materials used’ means the value of the non-originating materials used in the production of the product, which is its customs value at the time of importation, including freight, insurance if appropriate, packing and all other costs incurred in transporting the materials to the importation port in the Party where the producer of the product is located; where the value of the non-originating materials is not known and cannot be ascertained, the first ascertainable price paid for the non-originating materials in the Union or in the United Kingdom is used.

### Article 4: Relevant international standards

The Parties recognise that the WP.29 is the relevant international standardising body and that UN Regulations and GTRs under the 1958 Agreement and 1998 Agreement are relevant international standards for the products covered by this Annex.

### Article 5: Regulatory convergence based on relevant international standards

1. The Parties shall refrain from introducing or maintaining any domestic technical regulation, marking, or conformity assessment procedure diverging from UN Regulations or GTRs in areas covered by such Regulations or GTRs, including where the relevant UN Regulations or GTRs have not been completed but their completion is imminent, unless there are substantiated reasons why a specific UN Regulation or GTR is an ineffective or inappropriate means for the fulfilment of legitimate objectives pursued, for example, in the areas of road safety or the protection of the environment or human health.

2. A Party which introduces a divergent domestic technical regulation, marking, or conformity assessment procedure as referred to in paragraph 1, at the request of the other Party, shall identify the parts of the domestic technical regulation, marking, or conformity assessment procedure which substantially diverge from the relevant UN Regulations or GTRs and provide justification for the divergence.

3. Each Party shall systematically consider applying UN Regulations adopted after the entry into force of this Agreement, and shall inform each other of any changes regarding the implementation of those UN Regulations in its respective domestic legal system following the protocol established under the 1958 Agreement and in line with Articles 8 and 9.

Insofar as a Party has introduced or maintains domestic technical regulations, markings or conformity assessment procedures that diverge from UN Regulations or GTRs as permitted by paragraph 1, that Party shall review those domestic technical regulations, markings or conformity assessment procedures at regular intervals, preferably not exceeding five years, with a view to increasing their convergence with the relevant UN Regulations or GTRs. When reviewing their domestic technical regulations, markings and conformity assessment procedures, each Party shall consider whether the justification for the divergence still exists. The outcome of these reviews, including any scientific and technical information used, shall be notified to the other Party upon request.

5. Each Party shall refrain from introducing or maintaining domestic technical regulations, markings, or conformity assessment procedures which have the effect of prohibiting, restricting or increasing the burden for the importation and putting into service on their domestic market of products type-approved under UN Regulations for the areas covered by those UN Regulations unless such domestic technical regulations, markings or conformity assessment procedures are explicitly provided for by those UN Regulations.

### Article 6: Type approval and market surveillance

1. Each Party shall accept on its market products which are covered by a valid UN type-approval certificate as compliant with its domestic technical regulations, markings and conformity assessment procedures, without requiring any further testing or marking to verify or attest compliance with any requirement covered by the UN type approval certificate concerned. In the case of vehicle approvals, the UN Universal International Whole Vehicle Type Approval (U-IWVTA) shall be considered valid in respect of the requirements covered by the U-IWVTA. UN type-approval certificates issued by a Party can only be considered valid if that Party has acceded to the relevant UN Regulations.

2. Each Party shall only be required to accept valid UN type-approval certificates issued pursuant to the latest version of the UN Regulations it has acceded to.

3. For the purpose of paragraph 1, the following shall be considered sufficient proof of the existence of a valid UN type-approval:
    (a) for whole vehicles, a valid UN Declaration of Conformance certifying compliance with a U-IWVTA;
    (b) for equipment and parts, a valid UN type-approval mark affixed to the product; or
    (c.) for equipment and parts to which a UN type-approval mark cannot be affixed, a valid UN type-approval certificate.

4. For the purpose of conducting market surveillance, the competent authorities of a Party may verify that the products covered comply, as appropriate, with
    (a) all the domestic technical regulations of that Party; or
    (b) the UN Regulations with which compliance has been attested, in accordance with this Article, by a valid UN Declaration of Conformance certifying compliance with a U-IWVTA in the case of whole vehicles, or by a valid UN type-approval mark affixed to the product or a valid UN type-approval certificate in the case of equipment and parts.

Such verifications shall be carried out by random sampling in the market and in accordance with the technical regulations referred to in point (a) or (b) of this paragraph, as the case may be.

5. The Parties shall endeavour to cooperate in the field of market surveillance to support the identification and addressing of non-conformities of vehicles, systems, components or separate technical units.

6.

1. The specified criteria for qualification as an Authorised Economic Operator ("AEO") referred to in
Article CUSTMS.9 [Authorised Economic Operators] of this Agreement, shall be established by the
Parties’ laws, regulations or procedures. The specified criteria, which shall be published, shall
include:

    (a) the absence of any serious infringement or repeated infringements of customs legislation and
taxation rules, including no record of serious criminal offences relating to the economic activity of
the applicant;

    (b) the demonstration by the applicant of a high level of control of his or her operations and of the
flow of goods, by means of a system of managing commercial and, where appropriate, transport
records, which allows appropriate customs controls;

    (c.) financial solvency which shall be deemed to be proven where the applicant has good financial
standing, which enables him or her to fulfil his or her commitments, with due regard to the
characteristics of the type of business activity concerned; and

    (d) appropriate security and safety standards which shall be considered as fulfilled where the
applicant demonstrates that he or she maintains appropriate measures to ensure the security and
safety of the international supply chain including in the areas of physical integrity and access
controls, logistical processes and handling of specific types of goods, personnel and identification of
his or her business partners.

2. The specified criteria for qualification as an AEO shall not be designed or applied so as to afford or
create arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination between operators where the same conditions
prevail. Those criteria shall allow small and medium-sized enterprises to qualify as AEOs.

3. The trade partnership programme referred to in Article CUSTMS.9 [Authorised Economic
Operators] of this Agreement shall include the following treatment:
    (a) taking the AEO status granted by the other Party favourably into account in its risk assessment to
reduce inspections or controls and in other security and safety-related measures;
    (b) giving priority to the inspection of consignments covered by exit or entry summary declarations
lodged by an AEO, if the customs authority decides to proceed with an inspection;
    (c.) taking the AEO status granted by the other Party into account with a view to treating the AEO as
a secure and safe partner when assessing requirements concerning business partners for applicants
under its own Programme; and
    (d) endeavouring to establish a joint business continuity mechanism to respond to disruptions in
trade flows due to increases in security alerts levels, border closures and/or natural disasters,
hazardous emergencies or other major incidents where priority cargos related to AEOs could be
facilitated and expedited to the extent possible by the customs authorities of the Parties.

### Article 2 Mutual recognition and responsibility for implementation

1. AEO Status under the trade partnership programmes of the Union and the United Kingdom are
recognised to be compatible, and holders of the AEO status granted under each programme shall be
treated in a manner consistent with Article 4.

2. The trade partnership programmes concerned are:
    a) The European Union Authorised Economic operator (security and safety). (point (b) of Article 38(2) UCC); and

trade partnership programmes with respect to the following matters:
    (a) the application process for granting the AEO status to operators;
    (b) the assessment of AEO status applications;
    (c.) the granting of the AEO status; and
    (d) the managing, monitoring, suspension and re-assessment, and revocation of the AEO status.
The Parties shall ensure that their customs authorities monitor AEOs′ compliance with the relevant conditions and criteria.

2. The Parties shall complete a joint work programme setting out a minimum number of joint
validations of holders of the AEO status granted under each trade partnership programme that must
be completed by the end of 2021, at the latest.

3. The Parties shall ensure that their trade partnership programmes operate within the relevant
standards of the SAFE Framework.

### Article 4 Treatment of status holders

1. Each Party shall provide comparable treatment to that given to AEOs under the other Party’s
trade partnership programme. This treatment shall include in particular the treatment set out in
paragraph 3 of Article 1.

2. Each Party may suspend the treatment referred to in paragraph 3 of Article 1 to an AEO under the
other Party’s trade partnership programme under this Agreement if that AEO ceases to comply with
the legal requirements. Such suspension shall be promptly communicated to the other customs
authority together with any additional information regarding the basis for suspension, as
appropriate.

3. Each Party shall promptly inform the other Party in cases where it identifies any irregularity
committed by an AEO authorised by the other customs authority to allow it to take an informed
decision on the possible revocation or suspension of the membership of the operator concerned.

### Article 5 Exchange of information and communication

1.The Parties shall endeavour to communicate effectively with each other in the implementation of
this Agreement. They shall exchange information and foster communication regarding their trade

### ANNEX SERVIN-1: EXISTING MEASURES

**Headnotes**

1. The Schedules of the United Kingdom and the Union set out, under Article SERVIN 2.7 [Non-
conforming measures – Investment liberalisation], Article SERVIN.3.6 [Non-conforming measures –
Cross-border trade in services], and Article SERVIN 5.50 [Non-conforming measures – Legal services]
the reservations taken by the United Kingdom and the Union with respect to existing measures that
do not conform with obligations imposed by:
    (a) Articles SERVIN.2.2 [Market access– Investment liberalisation] or SERVIN.3.2 [Market
access - Cross-border trade in services];
    (b) Article SERVIN.3.3 [Local presence – Cross-border trade in services;
    (c.) Articles SERVIN.2.3 [National treatment– Investment liberalisation] or SERVIN.3.
[National treatment - Cross-border trade in services];
    (d) Articles SERVIN.2.4 [Most-favoured-nation treatment– Investment liberalisation], or
SERVIN.3.5 [Most-favoured-nation treatment - Cross-border trade in services];
    (e) Article SERVIN.2.5 [Senior management and boards of directors];
    (f) Article SERVIN.2.6 [Performance requirements]; or
    (g) Article SERVIN.5.49 [Obligations – Legal services].

2. The reservations of a Party are without prejudice to the rights and obligations of the Parties under
GATS.

3. Each reservation sets out the following elements:
(a) "sector" refers to the general sector in which the reservation is taken;
(b) "sub-sector" refers to the specific sector in which the reservation is taken;
(c.) "industry classification" refers, where applicable, to the activity covered by the
reservation according to the CPC, ISIC Rev. 3.1, or as expressly otherwise described in
that reservation;
(d) "type of reservation" specifies the obligation referred to in paragraph 1 for which a
reservation is taken;
(e) "level of government" indicates the level of government maintaining the measure for
which a reservation is taken;
(f) "measures" identifies the laws or other measures as qualified, where indicated, by the
"description" element for which the reservation is taken. A "measure" cited in the
"measures" element:
    (i) means the measure as amended, continued or renewed as of the date of entry
into force of this Agreement;
    (ii) includes any subordinate measure adopted or maintained under the authority of
and consistent with the measure; and
    (iii) in respect of the schedule of the European Union, includes any laws or other
measures which implement a directive at Member State level; and
(g) "description" sets out the non-conforming aspects of the existing measure for which the
reservation is taken.

4. For greater certainty, if a Party adopts a new measure at a level of government different to
that at which the reservation was originally taken, and this new measure effectively replaces –
within the territory to which it applies – the non-conforming aspect of the original measure cited in
the ‘measures’ element, the new measure shall be deemed to constitute ‘modification’ to the
original measure within the meaning of Article SERVIN.2.7(1)(c) [Non-conforming measures –
Investment liberalisation]; Article SERVIN.3.6(1)(c) [Non-conforming measures – Cross-border trade
in services]; Article 4.5(c) [Non-conforming measures – Entry and temporary stay of natural persons
for business purposes] and Article SERVIN.5.50 [Non-conforming measures – Legal services].

5. In the interpretation of a reservation, all elements of the reservation shall be considered. A
reservation shall be interpreted in the light of the relevant obligations of the Chapters or Sections
against which the reservation is taken. The "measures" element shall prevail over all other elements.

6. For the purposes of the Schedules of the United Kingdom and the Union:
(a) “ISIC Rev. 3.1” means the International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic
Activities as set out in Statistical Office of the United Nations, Statistical Papers, Series
M, No.4, ISIC Rev. 3.1, 2002;
(b) “CPC” means the Provisional Central Product Classification (Statistical Papers, Series M
No. 77, Department of International Economic and Social Affairs, Statistical Office of the
United Nations, New York, 1991).

7. For the purposes of the Schedules of the United Kingdom and the Union, a reservation for a
requirement to have a local presence in the territory of the Union or the United Kingdom is taken
against Article SERVIN 3.3 [Local presence], and not against Article SERVIN 3.2 [Market access] or
SERVIN 3.4 [National treatment]. Furthermore, such a requirement is not taken as a reservation
against Article SERVIN 2.3 [National treatment].

8. A reservation taken at the level of the Union applies to a measure of the Union, to a
measure of a Member State at the central level or to a measure of a government within a Member
State, unless the reservation excludes a Member State. A reservation taken by a Member State
applies to a measure of a government at the central, regional or local level within that Member
State. For the purposes of the reservations of Belgium, the central level of government covers the
federal government and the governments of the regions and the communities as each of them holds
equipollent legislative powers. For the purposes of the reservations of the Union and its Member
States, a regional level of government in Finland means the Åland Islands. A reservation taken at the
level of the United Kingdom applies to a measure of the central government, a regional government
or a local government.

9. The list of reservations below does not include measures relating to qualification
requirements and procedures, technical standards and licensing requirements and procedures
where they do not constitute a limitation within the meaning of Article SERVIN.2.2 [Market access –
Investment liberalisation], Article SERVIN.2.3 [National treatment – Investment liberalisation],
Article SERVIN.3.2 [Market access – Cross-border trade in services], Article SERVIN.3.3 [Local
presence – Cross-border trade in services], Article SERVIN.3.4 [National treatment – Cross-border trade in services] or Article SERVIN 5.49 [Obligations – Legal services]. These measures may include,
in particular, the need to obtain a licence, to satisfy universal service obligations, to have recognised
qualifications in regulated sectors, to pass specific examinations, including language examinations,
to fulfil a membership requirement of a particular profession, such as membership in a professional
organisation, to have a local agent for service, or to maintain a local address, or any other non-
discriminatory requirements that certain activities may not be carried out in protected zones or
areas. While not listed, such measures continue to apply.

10. For greater certainty, for the Union, the obligation to grant national treatment does not
entail the requirement to extend to natural or legal persons of the United Kingdom the treatment
granted in a Member State, pursuant to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, or any
measure adopted pursuant to that Treaty, including their implementation in the Member States, to:
(i) natural persons or residents of another Member State; or
(ii) legal persons constituted or organised under the law of another Member State or of the
Union and having their registered office, central administration or principal place of
business in the Union.

11. Treatment granted to legal persons established by investors of a Party in accordance with
the law of the other Party (including, in the case of the Union, the law of a Member State) and
having their registered office, central administration or principal place of business within that other
Party, is without prejudice to any condition or obligation, consistent with Chapter 2 [Investment
liberalisation] of Title II [Services and investment] of Heading One [Trade] of Part Two [Trade,
transport and fisheries], which may have been imposed on such legal person when it was
established in that other Party, and which shall continue to apply.

12. The schedules apply only to the territories of the United Kingdom and the Union in
accordance with Article FINPROV.1[Territorial scope] and Article OTH.9(2) [Geographical scope] and
are only relevant in the context of trade relations between the Union and its Member States with
the United Kingdom. They do not affect the rights and obligations of the Member States under
Union law.

13. For greater certainty, non-discriminatory measures do not constitute a market access
limitation within the meaning of Articles SERVIN. 2.2 [Market access – Investment liberalisation],
SERVIN.3.2 [Market access – Cross-border trade in services], or Article SERVIN.5.49 [Obligations –
Legal services] for any measure:
(a) requiring the separation of the ownership of infrastructure from the ownership of the
goods or services provided through that infrastructure to ensure fair competition, for
example in the fields of energy, transportation and telecommunications;
(b) restricting the concentration of ownership to ensure fair competition;
(c) seeking to ensure the conservation and protection of natural resources and the
environment, including a limitation on the availability, number and scope of concessions
granted, and the imposition of a moratorium or ban;
(d) limiting the number of authorisations granted because of technical or physical
constraints, for example telecommunications spectra and frequencies; or
(e) requiring that a certain percentage of the shareholders, owners, partners, or directors of
an enterprise be qualified or practice a certain profession such as lawyers or
accountants.

14. With respect to financial services: Unlike foreign subsidiaries, branches established directly
in a Member State by a non-European Union financial institution are not, with certain limited
exceptions, subject to prudential regulations harmonised at Union level which enable such
subsidiaries to benefit from enhanced facilities to set up new establishments and to provide cross-
border services throughout the Union. Therefore, such branches receive an authorisation to operate
in the territory of a Member State under conditions equivalent to those applied to domestic financial
institutions of that Member State, and may be required to satisfy a number of specific prudential
requirements such as, in the case of banking and securities, separate capitalisation and other
solvency requirements and reporting and publication of accounts requirements or, in the case of
insurance, specific guarantee and deposit requirements, a separate capitalisation, and the
localisation in the Member State concerned of the assets representing the technical reserves and at
least one third of the solvency margin.

foreigners, where the acquisition of immovable property exceeds the extent necessary for the
erection of a premises for a house or professional roof, or otherwise exceeds the extent of two
donums (2,676 square meter), any permit granted by the Council of Ministers shall be subject to
such terms, limitations, conditions and criteria which are set by Regulations made by the Council of
Ministers and approved by the House of Representatives. A foreigner is any person who is not a
citizen of the Republic of Cyprus, including a foreign controlled company. The term does not include

property will be permitted if the applicant is going to use the real property as his or her primary
residence.

For legal persons that are not registered in Denmark, acquisition of real property will in general be
permitted, if the acquisition is a prerequisite for the business activities of the purchaser. Permission
is also required if the applicant is going to use the real property as a secondary dwelling. Such
permission will only be granted if the applicant through an overall and concrete assessment is
regarded to have particular strong ties to Denmark.

Permission under the Acquisition Act is only granted for the acquisition of a specific real property.
The acquisition of agricultural land by natural or legal persons is in addition governed by the Danish
Agricultural Holdings Act, which imposes restrictions on all persons, Danish or foreign, when
acquiring agricultural property. Accordingly, any natural or legal person, who wishes to acquire
agricultural real property, must fulfil the requirements in this Act. This generally means a limited
residence requirement on the agricultural holding applies. The residence requirement is not
personal. Legal entities must be of the types listed in §20 and §21 of the act and must be registered

production of agricultural products listed in Annex I to the Treaty on the Functioning of the
European Union, except fishery products and cotton (hereinafter agricultural product).

iii. ten hectares or more of forest land if the legal person has been engaged, for three years
immediately preceding the year of making the transaction of acquisition of the immovable, in
forest management within the meaning of the Forest Act (hereinafter forest management) or

iv. less than ten hectares of agricultural land and less than ten hectares of forest land, but ten
hectares or more of agricultural and forest land in total, if the legal person has been engaged, for three years immediately preceding the year of making the transaction of acquisition of the

United Kingdom or by nationals of the United Kingdom. After the granting of an authorisation, no
entity may come under the direct or indirect control of the United Kingdom or a national of the
United Kingdom without the prior approval of the Council of Ministers. The Council of Ministers may


refuse to grant an authorisation to an entity which is effectively controlled by the United Kingdom or
by a national of the United Kingdom, if the United Kingdom does not grant entities of the Republic or
entities of Member States as regards access to and exercise of the activities of prospecting, exploring

technologies. For greater certainty, such measures include the prohibition of the use of cyanide
leaching in the treatment or refining of minerals, the requirement of a specific authorisation in the
case of fracking for activities of prospecting, exploration or extraction of oil and gas, as well as prior
approval by local referendum in the case of nuclear/radioactive mineral resources. This does not
increase the non-conforming aspects of the existing measure for which the reservation is taken. (ISIC

discriminatory requirements that certain activities may not be carried out in protected zones or
areas. While not listed, such measures continue to apply.
9. For greater certainty, for the European Union, the obligation to grant national treatment
does not entail the requirement to extend to natural or legal persons of the United Kingdom the
treatment granted in a Member State, pursuant to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European
Union, or any measure adopted pursuant to that Treaty, including their implementation in the
Member States, to:

 
(i) natural persons or residents of another Member State; or

accordance with Article FINPROV.1 [Territorial Scope] and Article OTH.9.2 [Geographical Scope] and
are only relevant in the context of trade relations between the Union and its Member States with
the United Kingdom. They do not affect the rights and obligations of the Member States under
Union law.
12. For greater certainty, non-discriminatory measures do not constitute a market access
limitation within the meaning of Articles SERVIN. 2.2 [Market access – Investment liberalisation], or
SERVIN.3.2 [Market access – Cross-border trade in services] or Article SERVIN.5.49 [Obligations –
Legal services] for any measure:

goods or services provided through that infrastructure to ensure fair competition, for
example in the fields of energy, transportation and telecommunications;
 
 
(b) restricting the concentration of ownership to ensure fair competition;

an enterprise be qualified or practice a certain profession such as lawyers or
accountants.
 
13. With respect to financial services: Unlike foreign subsidiaries, branches established directly
in a Member State by a non-European Union financial institution are not, with certain limited
exceptions, subject to prudential regulations harmonised at European Union level which enable such
subsidiaries to benefit from enhanced facilities to set up new establishments and to provide cross-
border services throughout the Union. Therefore, such branches receive an authorisation to operate
in the territory of a Member State under conditions equivalent to those applied to domestic financial
institutions of that Member State, and may be required to satisfy a number of specific prudential
requirements such as, in the case of banking and securities, separate capitalisation and other
solvency requirements and reporting and publication of accounts requirements or, in the case of
insurance, specific guarantee and deposit requirements, a separate capitalisation, and the
localisation in the Member State concerned of the assets representing the technical reserves and at
least one third of the solvency margin.

services, environmental services, health services, transport services and services auxiliary to all
modes of transport. Exclusive rights on such services are often granted to private operators, for

##### ANNEX SERVIN-5: MOVEMENT OF NATURAL PERSONS

 
Article 1: Entry and temporary stay-related procedural commitments
 
The Parties shall endeavour to ensure that the processing of applications for entry and temporary
stay pursuant to their respective commitments in the Agreement follows good administrative
practice:

(a) Each Party shall ensure that fees charged by competent authorities for the processing of
applications for entry and temporary stay do not unduly impair or delay trade in services
under this Agreement;

(b) subject to the discretion of the competent authorities of each Party, documents required from
an applicant for applications for the grant of entry and temporary stay of short-term visitors
for business purposes should be commensurate with the purpose for which they are collected;

(c) complete applications for the grant of entry and temporary stay shall be processed by the
competent authorities of each Party as expeditiously as possible;

(d) the competent authorities of each Party shall endeavour to provide, without undue delay,
information in response to any reasonable request from an applicant concerning the status of
an application;

(e) if the competent authorities of a Party require additional information from an applicant in
order to process the application, they shall endeavour to notify, without undue delay, the
applicant;

(f) the competent authorities of each Party shall notify the applicant of the outcome of the
application promptly after a decision has been taken;

(g) if an application is approved, the competent authorities of each Party shall notify the applicant
of the period of stay and other relevant terms and conditions;

(h) if an application is denied, the competent authorities of a Party shall, upon request or upon
their own initiative make available to the applicant information on any available review and
appeal procedures; and

(i) each Party shall endeavour to accept and process applications in electronic format.

 
Article 2: Additional procedural commitments applying to intra-corporate transferees and their
partner, children and family members^132
 
1. The competent authorities of each Party shall adopt a decision on an application for an intra-
corporate transferee entry or temporary stay or a renewal thereof and notify the decision to the
applicant in writing, in accordance with the notification procedures under national law, as soon as
possible but not later than 90 days after the date on which the complete application was submitted.

(^132) Paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 do not apply for the Member States that are not subject to the application of the
Directive 2014/66/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 May 2014 on the conditions
of entry and residence of third-country nationals in the framework of an intra- corporate transfer ("ICT
Directive").


2. Where the information or documentation supplied in support of the application is
incomplete, the competent authorities concerned shall endeavour to notify the applicant within a
reasonable period of the additional information that is required and set a reasonable deadline for

##### ANNEX SERVIN-6: GUIDELINES FOR ARRANGEMENTS ON THE RECOGNITION OF PROFESSIONAL

##### QUALIFICATIONS

 
SECTION A: General Provisions
 
 
Introduction
 
1. This Annex contains guidelines for arrangements on the conditions for the recognition of
professional qualifications (“arrangements”), as foreseen by Article SERVIN.5.13 [Professional
qualifications].
2. Pursuant to that Article, these guidelines shall be taken into account in the development of
joint recommendations by professional bodies or authorities of the Parties (“joint
recommendations”).
3. The guidelines are non-binding, non-exhaustive and do not modify or affect the rights and
obligations of the Parties under this Agreement. They set out the typical content of arrangements,
and provide general indications as to the economic value of an arrangement and the compatibility of
the respective professional qualifications regimes.
4. Not all elements of these guidelines may be relevant in all cases and professional bodies and
authorities are free to include in their joint recommendations any other element that they consider
pertinent for the arrangements of the profession and the professional activities concerned,
consistent with this Agreement.
5. The guidelines should be taken into account by the Partnership Council when deciding
whether to develop and adopt arrangements. They are without prejudice to its review of the
consistency of joint recommendations with Title II [Services and Investment] of Heading One [Trade]
of Part Two [Trade, transport and fisheries]and its discretion to take into account the elements it
deems relevant, including those contained in joint recommendations.

 
SECTION B: Form and Content of an Arrangement
 
6. This section sets out the typical content of an arrangement, some of which is not within the
remit of the professional bodies or authorities preparing joint recommendations. These aspects
constitute, nonetheless, useful information to be taken into account in the preparation of joint
recommendations, so that they are better adapted to the possible scope of an arrangement.
7. Matters addressed specifically in this Agreement which apply to arrangements (such as the
geographical scope of an arrangement, its interaction with scheduled non-conforming measures, the
system of dispute resolution, appeal mechanisms, monitoring and review mechanisms of the
arrangement) should not be addressed by joint recommendations.
8. An arrangement may specify different mechanisms for the recognition of professional
qualifications within a Party. It may also be limited, but not necessarily so, to setting the scope of the
arrangement, the procedural provisions, the effects of recognition and additional requirements, and
the administrative arrangements.
9. An arrangement which is adopted by the Partnership Council should reflect the degree of
discretion that is intended to be preserved for competent authorities deciding on recognition.

 
Scope of an Arrangement
 

10. The arrangement should set out:

(a) the specific regulated profession(s), relevant professional title(s) and the activity or group of
activities covered by the scope of practice of the regulated profession in both Parties (“scope
of practice”); and

(b) whether it covers the recognition of professional qualifications for the purpose of access to
professional activities on a fixed-term or an indefinite basis.

 
Conditions for recognition
 
11. The arrangement may specify in particular:

(a) the professional qualifications necessary for recognition under the arrangement (for example,
evidence of formal qualification, professional experience, or other attestation of
competence);

(b) the degree of discretion preserved by recognition authorities when assessing requests for
recognition of these qualifications; and

(c) the procedures to deal with variations and gaps between professional qualifications and
means to bridge the differences, including the possibility for imposing any compensatory
measures or any other relevant conditions and limitations.

 
Procedural provisions
 
12. The arrangement may set out:

(a) the documents required and the form in which they should be presented (for example, by
electronic or other means, whether they should be supported by translations or certifications
of authenticity, etc.);

(b) the steps and procedures in the recognition process, including those relating to possible
compensatory measures, corresponding obligations and timelines; and

(c) the availability of information relevant to all aspects of the recognition processes and
requirements.

 
Effects of recognition and additional requirements
 
13. The arrangement may set out provisions on the effects of recognition (if relevant, also in
respect of different modes of supply);
14. The arrangement may describe any additional requirements for the effective exercise of the
regulated profession in the host Party. Such requirements may include:

(a) registration requirements with local authorities;

(b) appropriate language skills;

(c) proof of good character;

(d) compliance with the requirements of the host Party for use of trade or firm names;


(e) compliance with the rules of ethics, independence and professional conduct requirements of
the host Party;

(f) need to obtain professional indemnity insurance;

(g) rules on disciplinary action, financial responsibility and professional liability; and

(h) requirements for continuous professional development.

 
Administration of the arrangement
 
15. The arrangement should set out the terms under which it can be reviewed or revoked, and
the effects of any revision or revocation. Consideration may also be given to the inclusion of
provisions concerning the effects of any recognition previously accorded.

 
SECTION C: Economic value of an envisaged arrangement
 
16. Pursuant to Article SERVIN 5.13(2) [Professional qualifications], joint recommendations shall
be supported by an evidence-based assessment of the economic value of an envisaged arrangement.
This may consist of an evaluation of the economic benefits that an arrangement is expected to bring
to the economies of both Parties. Such an assessment may assist the Partnership Council when
developing and adopting an arrangement.
17. Aspects such as the existing level of market openness, industry needs, market trends and
developments, client expectations and requirements and business opportunities would constitute
useful elements.
18. The evaluation is not required to be a full and detailed economic analysis, but should
provide an explanation of the interest of the profession in, and the expected benefits for the Parties
ensuing from, the adoption of an arrangement.

 
SECTION D: Compatibility of respective professional qualification regimes
 
19. Pursuant to Article SERVIN 5.13(2) [Professional qualifications], joint recommendations shall
be supported by an evidence-based assessment of the compatibility of the respective professional
qualification regimes. This assessment may assist the Partnership Council when developing and
adopting an arrangement.
20. The following process aims at guiding professional bodies and authorities when assessing
the compatibility of the respective professional qualifications and activities with a view to simplifying
and facilitating the recognition of professional qualifications.

Step One: Assessment of the scope of practice and the professional qualifications required to
practise the regulated profession in each Party.

21. The assessment of the scope of practice and of the professional qualifications required to
practise a regulated profession in each of the Parties should be based on all relevant information.
22. The following elements should be identified:

(a) activities or groups of activities covered by the scope of practice of the regulated profession in
each Party; and


(b) the professional qualifications required in each Party to practise the regulated profession,
which may include any of the following elements:

(i) the minimum education required, for example, entry requirements, level of education, length
of study and contents of study;

(ii) the minimum professional experience required, for example, location, length and conditions
of practical training or supervised professional practice prior to registration, licensing or
equivalent;

(iii) examinations passed, especially examinations of professional competency; and

(iv) obtention the acquisition of a licence, or equivalent, certifying, inter alia, the fulfilment of the
necessary professional qualification requirements for the pursuit of the profession.

Step Two: Evaluation of the divergence between the scope of practice of, or the professional
qualifications required to practise, the regulated profession in each Party.

23. The evaluation of the divergence in the scope of practice of, or in the professional
qualifications required to practise, the regulated profession, in each Party, should in particular
identify divergence that is substantial.
24. Substantial divergence in the scope of practice may exist if all of the following conditions are
met:

(a) one or more activities covered by a regulated profession in the host Party are not covered by
the corresponding profession in the Party of origin;

(b) such activities are subject to specific training in the host Party;

(c) the training for such activities in the host Party covers matters substantially diverging from
those covered by the applicant's qualification.

25. Substantial divergence in the professional qualifications required to practise a regulated
profession may exist if there are divergences in the Parties’ requirements with regard to the level,
duration or content of the training that is required for the pursuit of activities covered by the
regulated profession.

Step Three: Recognition mechanisms

26. There may be different mechanisms for the recognition of professional qualifications,
depending on the circumstances. There may be different mechanisms within a Party.
27. If there is no substantial divergence in the scope of practice and in the professional
qualifications required to practise a regulated profession, an arrangement may provide for a simpler,
more streamlined recognition process than would be the case where substantial divergence exists.
28. If there is substantial divergence, the arrangement may provide for compensatory measures
which are sufficient to remedy such divergence.
29. Where compensatory measures are used to reduce substantial divergence, they should be
proportionate to the divergence that they seek to address. Any practical professional experience or


formally validated training could be taken into account to assess the extent of the compensatory
measures needed.

30. Whether or not the divergence is substantial, the arrangement may take account of the
degree of discretion that is intended to be preserved for competent authorities deciding on
recognition requests.
31. Compensatory measures may take different forms, including:

(a) a period of supervised practice of a regulated profession in the host Party, possibly
accompanied by further training, under the responsibility of a qualified person and subject to
a regulated assessment;

(b) a test made or recognised by the relevant authorities of the host Party to assess the
applicant’s ability to practice a regulated profession in that Party; or

(c) a temporary limitation of the scope of practice; or a combination of those.

32. The arrangement could envisage that a choice be given to applicants between different
compensatory measures where this could limit the administrative burden for applicants and such
measures are equivalent.

##### ANNEX ENER-2: ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SUBSIDIES

As part of the principles set out in Article 3.5(14) [Prohibited subsidies and subsidies subject to
conditions (Energy and environment)] of Chapter three [Subsidy control] of Title XI [Level playing
field for open and fair competition and sustainable development] of Heading One [Trade] of Part
Two of this Agreement:

(1) Subsidies for electricity generation adequacy, renewable energy and cogeneration shall not
undermine the ability of a Party to meet its obligations under Article ENER.6 [Provisions
relating to wholesale electricity and gas markets] of this Agreement, shall not unnecessarily
affect the efficient use of electricity interconnectors provided for under Article ENER.13
[Efficient use of electricity interconnectors], and, without prejudice to Article ENER 6(3)
[Provisions relating to wholesale electricity and gas markets] of this Agreement, shall be
determined by means of a transparent, non-discriminatory and effective competitive
process; and

 
(a) subsidies for electricity generation adequacy shall provide incentives for capacity
providers to be available in times of expected system stress and may be limited to
installations not exceeding specified CO 2 emission limits; and
 
 
(b) subsidies for renewable energy and cogeneration shall not affect beneficiaries’
obligations or opportunities to participate in electricity markets.
 
(2) Notwithstanding point 1, provided that appropriate measures are put in place to prevent
overcompensation, non-competitive procedures may be used to grant subsidies for
renewable energy and cogeneration if the potential supply is insufficient to ensure a
competitive process, the eligible capacity is unlikely to have a material effect on trade or
investment between the Parties, or subsidies are granted for demonstration projects.

(3) If partial exemptions from energy-related taxes and levies^134 in favour of energy-intensive
users are introduced, such exemptions shall not exceed the total amount of the tax or levy.

(4) If compensation for electricity-intensive users is granted in the event of an increase in
electricity cost resulting from climate policy instruments, it shall be restricted to sectors at
significant risk of carbon leakage due to the cost increase.

(5) Subsidies for the decarbonisation of emissions linked to own industrial activities shall
achieve an overall reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. The subsidies shall reduce the
emissions directly resulting from the industrial activity. Subsidies for improvements of the
energy efficiency of own industrial activities shall improve energy efficiency by reducing
energy consumption, either directly or per unit of production.

(^134) For greater certainty, levies do not include network charges or tariffs.


##### ANNEX ENER-3: NON-APPLICATION OF THIRD-PARTY ACCESS AND OWNERSHIP UNBUNDLING TO

##### INFRASTRUCTURE

A Party may decide not to apply Article ENER.8 [Third-party access to transmission and distribution
networks] and Article ENER.9 [System operation and unbundling of transmission network operators]
to new infrastructure or to a significant expansion of existing infrastructure where:

(a) the risk attached to the investment in the infrastructure is such that the investment would not

 
take place unless an exemption is granted;
 
(b) the investment enhances competition or security of supply;

(c) the infrastructure is owned by a natural or legal person separate, at least in terms of its legal

 
form, from the system operators in whose systems it was or is to be built;
 
(d) before granting the exemption, the Party has decided on the rules and mechanisms for

 
management and allocation of capacity.
 

##### ANNEX ENER-4: ALLOCATION OF ELECTRICITY INTERCONNECTOR CAPACITY AT THE DAY-AHEAD

##### MARKET TIMEFRAME

 
Part 1
 
1. The new procedure for the allocation of capacity on electricity interconnectors at the day-ahead

 
market timeframe shall be based on the concept of “Multi-region loose volume coupling”.
 
 
The overall objective of the new procedure shall be to maximise the benefits of trade.
 
 
As the first step in developing the new procedure, the Parties shall ensure that transmission system
operators prepare outline proposals and a cost-benefit analysis.
 
2. Multi-region loose volume coupling shall involve the development of a market coupling function to

 
determine the net energy positions (implicit allocation) between:
 
 
(a) bidding zones established in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2019/943, which are directly
connected to the United Kingdom by an electricity interconnector; and
 
 
(b) the United Kingdom.
 
3. The net energy positions over electricity interconnectors shall be calculated via an implicit allocation

 
process by applying a specific algorithm to:
 
 
(a) commercial bids and offers for the day-ahead market timeframe from the bidding zones
established in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2019/943 which are directly connected to the
United Kingdom by an electricity interconnector;
 
 
(b) commercial bids and offers for the day-ahead market timeframe from relevant day-ahead
markets in the United Kingdom;
 
 
(c) network capacity data and system capabilities determined in accordance with the procedures
agreed between transmission system operators; and
 
 
(d) data on expected commercial flows of electricity interconnections between bidding zones
connected to the United Kingdom and other bidding zones in the Union, as determined by
Union transmission system operators using robust methodologies.
 
 
This process shall be compatible with the specific characteristics of direct current electricity
interconnectors, including losses and ramping requirements.
 
4. The market coupling function shall:

 
(a) produce results sufficiently in advance of the operation of the Parties’ respective day-ahead
markets (for the Union this is single day-ahead coupling established in accordance with
 

 
Commission Regulation (EU) 2015/1222^135 ) in order that such results may be used as inputs
into the processes which determine the results in those markets;
 
 
(b) produce results which are reliable and repeatable;
 
 
(c) be a specific process to link the distinct and separate day-ahead markets in the Union and
the United Kingdom; in particular, this means that the specific algorithm shall be distinct and
separate from that used in single day-ahead coupling established in accordance with
Regulation (EU) 2015/1222 and, in respect of commercial bids and offers of the Union, only
have access to those from bidding zones which are directly connected to the United
Kingdom by an electricity interconnector.
 
5. The calculated net energy positions shall be published following validation and verification. If the

 
market coupling function is unable either to operate or to produce a result, electricity
interconnector capacity shall be allocated by a fall-back process, and market participants shall be
notified that the fall-back process will apply.
 
6. The costs of developing and implementing the technical procedures shall be equally shared between

 
the relevant United Kingdom transmission system operators or other entities, on the one side, and
relevant Union transmission system operators or other entities, on the other side, unless the
Specialised Committee on Energy decides otherwise.
 
 
Part 2
 
 
The timeline for the implementation of this Annex shall be from the entry into force of this
Agreement, as follows:
 
 
(a) within 3 months – cost benefit analysis and outline of proposals for technical procedures;
 
 
(b) within 10 months – proposal for technical procedures;
 
 
(c) within 15 months – entry into operation of technical procedures.

specify any special condition to be applied if the related airworthiness codes, laws, regulations and
administrative provisions do not contain adequate or appropriate safety requirements for the civil
aeronautical product, because:

(a) the civil aeronautical product has novel or unusual design features relative to the design
practices on which the applicable airworthiness codes, laws, regulations and administrative
provisions are based;

(b) the intended use of the civil aeronautical product is unconventional; or

(c) experience obtained from other, similar civil aeronautical products in service or civil
aeronautical products having similar design features has shown that unsafe conditions may

#### develop.

4. When specifying exemptions, deviations, compensating factors or special conditions, the
validating authority shall give due consideration to these applied by the certificating authority and
they shall not be more demanding for the civil aeronautical products to be validated than they
would be for its own similar products. The validating authority shall notify the certificating authority
of any such exemptions, deviations, compensating factors or special conditions.

 
Article 12: Level of involvement of the validating authority
 
1. The level of involvement of the validating authority of a Party during the validation process
referred to in Article 9 [Validation process] and as detailed in the technical implementation
procedures, shall be mainly determined by:

(a) the experience and records of the competent authority of the other Party as certificating
authority;

(b) the experience already gained by that validating authority during previous validation exercises
with the competent authority of the other Party;

(c) the nature of the design to be validated;

(d) the performance and experience of the applicant with the validating authority; and


(e) the outcome of qualification requirements assessments referred to in Articles 28
[Qualification requirements for the acceptance of findings of compliance and certificates] and
Article 29 [Continued qualifications of the competent authorities].

2. The validating authority shall exercise special procedures and scrutiny, in particular
regarding the certificating authority’s processes and methods, during the first validation of any
certificate, where the certificating authority has not previously issued a certificate in the category of
civil aeronautical products concerned after 30 September 2004. The procedures and criteria to be
applied shall be detailed in the technical implementation procedures.
3. The effective implementation of the principles set out in paragraphs 1 and 2 shall be
regularly measured, monitored, reviewed by the Certification Oversight Board, using metrics as
detailed in the technical implementation procedures.

 
Article 13: Acceptance
 
1 For a design certificate subject to acceptance, the validating authority shall accept the
design certificate issued by the certificating authority without any validation activities. In that case,
the design certificate shall be recognised by the validating authority as equivalent to a certificate
issued in accordance with laws, regulations and administrative provisions of its Party and the
validating authority shall not issue its corresponding certificate.

2. Non-significant supplemental type certificates, non-significant major changes and technical
standard order authorisations issued by the technical agent of the Union as certificating authority or
by an approved organisation under Union law shall be accepted by the technical agent of the United

certificates] and 13 [Acceptance]
 
1. The minor change or major change classifications shall be made by the certificating authority
in accordance with the definitions set out in this Annex and interpreted in accordance with the
applicable rules and procedures of the certificating authority.
2. For classifying a supplemental type certificate or major change as significant or non-
significant, the certificating authority shall consider the change in the context of all previous relevant
design changes and all related revisions to the applicable certification specifications incorporated in
the type certificate for the civil aeronautical product. Changes that meet either of the following
criteria are automatically considered as significant:

(a) the general configuration or the principles of construction are not retained; or

(b) the assumptions used for certification of the product to be changed do not remain valid.


 
Article 15: Existing design certificates

21(1) [Recognition of production certification and production oversight systems] may be extended to
include manufacturing sites and facilities of the manufacturer located in the territory of the other
Party or in the territory of a third country, irrespective of the legal status of those manufacturing
sites and facilities, and irrespective of the type of civil aeronautical product manufactured in those
sites and facilities. In that case, the competent authority of the exporting Party shall remain
responsible for the oversight of those manufacturing sites and facilities and the competent authority
of the importing Party shall not issue its own production approval to these manufacturing sites and
facilities for the same civil aeronautical product.
2. If facilities and manufacturing sites for a manufacturer primarily located in the territory of
the exporting Party are located in the other Party, the competent authorities of both Parties shall
cooperate with each other, in the framework of Article 32 [Support for certification and continued
airworthiness oversight activities], with a view to having the importing Party participating in the
oversight activities of the exporting Party in relation to these facilities.

Article 6 - Conditions relating to the requirement of good repute
 
1. Subject to paragraph 2, the Parties shall determine the conditions to be met by natural or
legal persons and transport managers in order to fulfil the requirement of good repute.

In determining whether a natural or legal person has fulfilled that requirement, the Parties shall
consider the conduct of the natural or legal person, its transport managers, executive directors and
any other relevant person as may be determined by the Party. Any reference in this Article to
convictions, penalties or infringements shall include convictions, penalties or infringements of the
natural or legal person itself, its transport managers, executive directors and any other relevant
person as may be determined by the Party.

The conditions referred to in the first part of this paragraph shall include at least the following:

(a) that there be no compelling grounds for doubting the good repute of the transport
manager or the road haulage operator, such as convictions or penalties for any serious
infringement of national rules in force in the fields of:

 
(i) commercial law;
 
 
(ii) insolvency law;
 
 
(iii) pay and employment conditions in the profession;
 
 
(iv) road traffic;

the transport manager or the road haulage operator has been convicted of a serious criminal offence
or has incurred a penalty for one of the most serious infringements as set out in Appendix
ROAD.A.1.1 in one or both Parties, the competent authority in the Party of establishment shall carry
out and complete in an appropriate and timely manner an administrative procedure, which shall
include, if appropriate, an on-site inspection at the premises of the natural or legal person
concerned.

During the administrative procedure, the competent authority shall assess whether, due to specific
circumstances, the loss of good repute would constitute a disproportionate response in the
individual case. In that assessment, the competent authority shall take into account the number of
serious infringements of the rules as referred to in the third subparagraph of paragraph 1 of this
Article, as well as the number of most serious infringements as set out in Appendix ROAD.A.1.1 for
which the transport manager or the road haulage operator have been convicted or had penalties
imposed on them. Any such finding shall be duly reasoned and justified.

Where the competent authority finds that the loss of good repute would be disproportionate, it shall
decide that the natural or legal person concerned continues to be of good repute. Where the
competent authority does not find that the loss of good repute would be disproportionate, the
conviction or penalty shall lead to the loss of good repute.

3. The Specialised Committee on Road Transport shall draw up a list of categories, types and
degrees of seriousness of serious infringements which, in addition to those set out in Appendix
ROAD.A.1.1, may lead to the loss of good repute.


4. The requirement of good repute shall not be fulfilled until a rehabilitation measure or any
other measure having an equivalent effect has been taken pursuant to the relevant provisions of
national law of the Parties.

 
Article 7 - Conditions relating to the requirement of financial standing

an undertaking demonstrate its financial standing by means of a certificate determined by the
competent authority, such as a bank guarantee or an insurance, including a professional liability
insurance from one or more banks or other financial institutions including insurance companies or

issued by a financial institution establishing access to credit in the name of the undertaking, or
another binding document as determined by the competent authority proving that the undertaking
has at its disposal the amounts specified in point (a) of paragraph 1.

repute.

 
Article 12 - Examination and registration of applications
 
1. The competent authorities in each Party shall record in the national electronic registers
referred to in Article 13(1) the data relating to undertakings which they authorise.

2. When assessing the good repute of an undertaking, the competent authorities shall verify,

in one of the Parties, unfit to manage the transport activities of an undertaking pursuant to Article
11.
3. The competent authorities shall regularly monitor whether undertakings which they have
authorised to engage in the occupation of road haulage operators continue to fulfil the
requirements referred to in Article 3. To that end, the competent authorities shall carry out checks,

## Section 2. Posting of drivers

 
Article 1 - Subject matter
 
This Section lays down requirements for road haulage operators established in one of the Parties
which, in the framework of the transport of goods, post drivers to the territory of the other Party in
accordance with Article 3 of this Section.

Nothing in this Section shall prevent a Party from applying measures to regulate the entry of natural
persons into, or their temporary stay in, its territory, including measures necessary to protect the
integrity of its borders and to ensure the orderly movement of natural persons across them,
provided that such measures are not applied in such a manner as to nullify or impair the benefits
accruing to the other Party under the terms of this Section. The sole fact of requiring a visa for
natural persons of certain countries and not for those of others shall not be regarded as nullifying or
impairing benefits under this Section.

Nothing in this Section shall affect the application on the Union territory of the Union rules on the
posting of drivers in road transport to Union road haulage operators.

 
Article 2 - Definitions
 
For the purposes of this Section, "posted driver" means a driver who, for a limited period, carries out
his or her work in the territory of a Party other than the Party in which the driver normally works.

 
Article 3 - Principles
 
1. The provisions of this Section apply to the extent that the road haulage operator posts
drivers to the territory of the other Party on its account and under its direction, under a contract
concluded between the road haulage operator making the posting and the party for whom the
transport services are intended, and those drivers operate in the territory of that Party, provided
that there is an employment relationship between the road haulage operator making the posting
and the driver during the period of posting.
2. For the purposes of paragraph 1, a posting shall be considered to start when the driver
enters the territory of the other Party for the loading and/or unloading of goods and to end when
the driver leaves the territory of that Party.

For the purposes of paragraph 1, in the case of posting in the Union, a posting shall, be considered to
start when the driver enters the territory of a Member State for the loading and/or unloading of
goods in that Member State and to end when the driver leaves the territory of that Member State.

3. Notwithstanding the paragraphs 1 and 2, a driver shall not be considered to be posted when
performing transport operations, based on a transport contract, as defined in point (a) of Article
ROAD.4(1) [Transport of goods between, through and within the territories of the Parties] of this
Agreement.
4. A driver shall not be considered to be posted in the United Kingdom where the driver
transits through the territory of the United Kingdom without loading or unloading of goods. For the
Union, a driver shall not be considered to be posted in a Member State when the driver transits
through the territory of that Member State without loading or unloading of goods.

 
Article 4 - Terms and conditions of employment
 

1. Each Party shall ensure, irrespective of which law applies to the employment relationship, that
road haulage operators guarantee, on the basis of equality of treatment, to drivers who are posted
to their territory the terms and conditions of employment covering the following matters which, in
the Party or, in the case of the Union, in the Member State where the work is carried out, are laid
down:

— by law, regulation or administrative provision; and/or

— by collective agreements or arbitration awards which have been declared universally applicable or
otherwise apply in accordance with paragraph 4:

(a) maximum work periods and minimum rest periods;

(b) minimum paid annual leave;

(c) remuneration, including overtime rates; this point does not apply to supplementary
occupational retirement pension schemes;

(d) health, safety and hygiene at work;

(e) protective measures with regard to the terms and conditions of employment of pregnant

 
women or women who have recently given birth, of children and of young people; and
 
(f) equality of treatment between men and women and other provisions on non-

 
discrimination.
 
2. For the purposes of this Section, the concept of remuneration shall be determined by the
national law and/or practice of the Party and, in the case of the Union, by the national law and/or
practice of the Member State, to whose territory the driver is posted and means all the constituent
elements of remuneration rendered mandatory by national law, regulation or administrative
provision, or by collective agreements or arbitration awards which, in that Party or in that Member
State, have been declared universally applicable or otherwise apply in accordance with paragraph 4.
3. Allowances specific to the posting shall be considered to be part of remuneration, unless
they are paid in reimbursement of expenditure actually incurred on account of the posting, such as
expenditure on travel, board and lodging. The road haulage operator shall reimburse the posted
driver for such expenditure in accordance with the law and/or practice applicable to the
employment relationship.

Where the terms and conditions of employment applicable to the employment relationship do not
determine which elements of the allowance specific to the posting are paid in reimbursement of
expenditure actually incurred on account of the posting or which are part of remuneration, then the
entire allowance shall be considered to be paid in reimbursement of expenditure.

4. For the purpose of this Section, "collective agreements or arbitration awards which have
been declared universally applicable" means collective agreements or arbitration awards which must
be observed by all undertakings in the geographical area and in the profession or industry
concerned.

In the absence of, or in addition to, a system for declaring collective agreements or arbitration
awards to be of universal application within the meaning of the first part of this paragraph, each
Party, or each Member State in the case of the Union, may, if they so decide, base themselves on:


— collective agreements or arbitration awards which are generally applicable to all similar
undertakings in the geographical area and in the profession or industry concerned; and/or

— collective agreements which have been concluded by the most representative employers' and
labour organisations at national level and which are applied throughout national territory.

Equality of treatment, within the meaning of paragraph 1, shall be deemed to exist where national
undertakings in a similar position:

 
(i) are subject, in the place in question or in the sector concerned, to the same
obligations as posting undertakings as regards the matters listed in the first
subparagraph of paragraph 1; and
(ii) are required to fulfil such obligations with the same effects.
 
 
Article 5 - Improved access to information
 
1. Each Party or, in the case of the Union, each Member State shall publish the information on
the terms and conditions of employment, in accordance with national law and/or practice, without
undue delay and in a transparent manner, on a single official national website, including the
constituent elements of remuneration as referred to in Article 4(2) and all the terms and conditions
of employment in accordance with Article 4(1).

Each Party or, in the case of the Union, each Member State shall ensure that the information
provided on the single official national website is accurate and up to date.

2. Each Party or, in the case of the Union, each Member State shall take the appropriate
measures to ensure that the information mentioned in paragraph 1 is made generally available free
of charge in a clear, transparent, comprehensive and easily accessible way at a distance and by
electronic means, in formats and in accordance with web accessibility standards that ensure access
to persons with disabilities and to ensure that competent national bodies are in a position to carry
out their tasks effectively.
3. Where, in accordance with national law, traditions and practice, including respect for the
autonomy of social partners, the terms and conditions of employment referred to in Article 4 are
laid down in collective agreements in accordance with Article 4(1), each Party or, in the case of the
Union, each Member State shall ensure that those terms and conditions are made available in an
accessible and transparent way to service providers from the other Party and to posted drivers, and
shall seek the involvement of the social partners in that respect. The relevant information should, in
particular, cover the different minimum rates of pay and their constituent elements, the method
used to calculate the remuneration due and, where relevant, the qualifying criteria for classification
in the different wage categories.
4. Where, contrary to paragraph 1, the information on the single official national website does
not indicate which terms and conditions of employment are to be applied, that circumstance shall be
taken into account in accordance with national law and/or practice in determining penalties in the
event of infringements to this Section, to the extent necessary to ensure the proportionality of those
penalties.
5. Each Party or, in the case of the Union, each Member State shall indicate the bodies and
authorities to which drivers and road haulage operators can turn for general information on national
law and practice applicable to them concerning their rights and obligations within their territory.


 
Article 6 - Administrative requirements, control and enforcement
 
1. Each Party or, in the case of the Union, each Member State may only impose the following
administrative requirements and control measures with respect to the posting of drivers:

(a) an obligation for the operator established in the other Party to submit a posting
declaration to the national competent authorities of the Party or, in the case of the Union,
of the Member State to which the driver is posted at the latest at the commencement of
the posting, using from 2 February 2022 a multilingual standard form of the public
interface connected to the EU Internal Market Information System^136 for administrative
cooperation (IMI); that posting declaration shall consist of the following information:

 
(i) the identity of the operator, at least in the form of the number of the valid licence
where this number is available;
 
 
(ii) the contact details of a transport manager or other contact person in the Party of
establishment or, in the case of the Union, in the Member State of establishment
to liaise with the competent authorities of the host Party or in, the case of the
Union, of the Member State in which the services are provided and to send out and
receive documents or notices;
 
 
(iii) the identity, the address of the residence and the number of the driving licence of
the driver;
 
 
(iv) the start date of the driver's contract of employment, and the law applicable to it;
 
 
(v) the envisaged start and end date of the posting; and
 
 
(vi) the number plates of the motor vehicles;
 
(b) an obligation for the operator to ensure that the driver has at his or her disposal in paper

 
or electronic form and an obligation for the driver to keep and make available when
requested at the roadside:
 
 
(i) a copy of the posting declaration submitted, via the IMI system from 2 February
2022;
 
 
(ii) evidence of the transport operations taking place in the host Party, such as an
electronic consignment note (e-CMR); and
 
 
(iii) the tachograph records and in particular the country symbols of the Party or, in the
case of the Union, of the Member State in which the driver was present when
carrying out transport operations, in accordance with registration and record-
keeping requirements under Section 2 of Part B and Section 4 of Part B;
 
(c) an obligation for the operator to send, from 2 February 2022 via the public interface
connected to the IMI system, after the period of posting, at the direct request of the
competent authorities of the other Party or, in the case of the Union, of a Member State
where the posting took place, copies of documents referred to in point (b) (ii) and (iii) of

(^136) Established by Regulation (EU) 1024/2012.


 
this paragraph as well as documentation relating to the remuneration of the driver in
respect of the period of posting, the employment contract or an equivalent document,
time-sheets relating to the driver's work, and proof of payments.
 
The operator shall send the documentation, from 2 February 2022 via the public interface connected
to the IMI system, no later than eight weeks from the date of the request. If the operator fails to
submit the requested documentation within that time period, the competent authorities of the
Party or, in the case of the Union, the Member State where the posting took place may request,
from 2 February 2022 via the IMI system, the assistance of the competent authorities of the Party of
establishment or, in the case of the Union, the Member State of establishment. When such a
request for mutual assistance is made, the competent authorities of the Party of establishment or, in
the case of the Union, the Member State of establishment of the operator shall have access to the
posting declaration and other relevant information submitted by the operator, from 2 February 2022
via the public interface connected to the IMI system.

The competent authorities of the Party of establishment or, in the case of the Union, of the Member
State of establishment shall ensure that they provide the requested documentation to the
competent authorities of the Party or, in the case of the Union, to the competent authorities of the
Member State where the posting took place, from 2 February 2022 via the IMI system, within 25
working days from the day of the request for mutual assistance.

Each Party shall ensure that the information exchanged by the competent national authorities or
transmitted to them shall be used only in respect of the matter or matters for which it was
requested.

Mutual administrative cooperation and assistance shall be provided free of charge.

A request for information shall not preclude the competent authorities from taking measures to
investigate and prevent alleged breaches of this Section.

3. For the purpose of ascertaining whether a driver is not to be considered to be posted
pursuant to Article 1, each Party may only impose as a control measure an obligation for the driver
to keep and make available, where requested at the roadside check, in paper or electronic form, the
evidence of the relevant transport operations, such as an electronic consignment note (e-CMR), and
tachograph records, as referred to in point (b)(iii) of paragraph 2 of this Article.
4. For the purposes of control, the operator shall keep the posting declarations referred to in
point (a) of paragraph 2 up to date, from 2 February 2022 in the public interface connected to IMI.
5. The information from the posting declarations shall be saved, from 2 February 2022, in the
IMI repository for the purpose of checks for a period of 24 months.
6. The Party or, in the case of the Union, the Member State to whose territory the driver is
posted and the Party or, in the case of the Union, the Member State from which the driver is posted
shall be responsible for the monitoring, control and enforcement of the obligations laid down in this
Section and shall take appropriate measures in the event of failure to comply with this Section.

_Section 2: Compulsory initial qualification provided for in point (a) of Article 3(1) of Section 1 of Part B_

A Party may count specific other training related to the transport of goods by road required under its
legislation as part of the training under this Section and under Section 3 of this Appendix.

2.1. Option combining both course attendance and a test

Initial qualification must include the teaching of all subjects in the list under Section 1 of this
Appendix. The duration of that initial qualification must be 280 hours.


Each trainee driver must drive for at least 20 hours individually in a vehicle of the category
concerned which meets at least the requirements for test vehicles.

When driving individually, the trainee driver must be accompanied by an instructor, employed by an
approved training centre. Each trainee driver may drive for a maximum of eight hours of the 20
hours of individual driving on special terrain or on a top-of-the-range simulator so as to assess
training in rational driving based on safety regulations, in particular with regard to vehicle handling
in different road conditions and the way they change with different atmospheric conditions, the
time of day or night, and the ability to optimise fuel consumption.

A Party and, in the case of the Union, a Member State may allow part of the training to be delivered
by the approved training centre by means of ICT tools, such as e-learning, while ensuring that the
high quality and the effectiveness of the training are maintained, and by selecting the subjects
where ICT tools can most effectively be deployed. Reliable user identification and appropriate means
of control shall be required in such a case.

For the drivers referred to in Article 5(4) of Section 1 of Part B the length of the initial qualification
must be 70 hours, including five hours of individual driving.

At the end of that training, the competent authorities in the Parties or the entity designated by them
shall give the driver a written or oral test. The test must include at least one question on each of the
objectives in the list of subjects under Section 1 of this Appendix.

2.2 Option involving a test

The competent authorities in the Parties or the entity designated by them shall organise the
aforementioned theoretical and practical tests to check whether the trainee driver has the level of
knowledge required in Section 1 of this Appendix for the subjects and objectives listed there.

(a) The theoretical test shall consist of at least two parts:

 
(i) questions including multiple-choice questions, questions requiring a direct answer,
or a combination of both; and
 
 
(ii) case studies.
 
The minimum duration of the theoretical test must be four hours.

(b) The practical test shall consist of two parts:

 
(i) a driving test aimed at assessing training in rational driving based on safety
regulations. The test must take place, whenever possible, on roads outside built-up
areas, on fast roads and on motorways (or similar), and on all kinds of urban
highways presenting the different types of difficulties that a driver is liable to
encounter. It would be desirable for that test to take place in different traffic
density conditions. The driving time on the road must be used optimally in order to
assess the candidate in all traffic areas likely to be encountered. The minimum
duration of that test must be 90 minutes;
 
 
(ii) a practical test covering at least points 1.5, 3.2, 3.3 and 3.5 of Section 1 of this
Appendix.
 
The minimum duration of that test must be 30 minutes.


The vehicle used for the practical test must meet at least the requirements for test vehicles.

The practical test may be supplemented by a third test taking place on special terrain or on a top-of
the-range simulator so as to assess training in rational driving based on safety regulations, in
particular with regard to vehicle handling in different road conditions and the way they change with
different atmospheric conditions and the time of day or night.

The duration of that optional test is not fixed. Should the driver undergo such a test, its duration
may be deducted from the 90 minutes of the driving test referred to under (i), but the time
deducted may not exceed 30 minutes.

For the drivers referred to in Article 5(4) of Section 1 of Part B, the theoretical test must be limited to
the subjects, referred to in Section 1 of this Appendix, which are relevant to the vehicles to which
the new initial qualification applies. However, such drivers must undergo the whole practical test.

 
Section 3: Accelerated initial qualification provided for in Article 3(2) of Section 1 of Part B of Annex
ROAD.1
 
Accelerated initial qualification must include the teaching of all subjects in the list in Section 1 of this
Appendix. Its duration must be 140 hours.

Each trainee driver must drive for at least 10 hours individually in a vehicle of the category
concerned which meets at least the requirements for test vehicles.

When driving individually, the trainee driver must be accompanied by an instructor, employed by an
approved training centre. Each trainee driver may drive for a maximum of four hours of the 10 hours
of individual driving on special terrain or on a top-of-the-range simulator so as to assess training in
rational driving based on safety regulations, in particular with regard to vehicle handling in different
road conditions and the way those road conditions change with different atmospheric conditions,
the time of day or night, and the ability to optimise fuel consumption.

The provisions of the fourth paragraph of point 2.1 of Section 2 of this Appendix shall also apply to
the accelerated initial qualification.

For the drivers referred to in Article 5(4) of Section 1 of Part B, the length of the accelerated initial
qualification must be 35 hours, including two-and-a-half hours of individual driving.

At the end of that training, the competent authorities in the Parties or the entity designated by them
shall give the driver a written or oral test. The test must include at least one question on each of the
objectives in the list of subjects under Section 1 of this Appendix.

A Party may count specific other training related to the transport of goods by road required under its
legislation as part of the training under this Section.

 
Section 4: Compulsory periodic training provided for in point (b) of Article 3(1) of Section 1 of Part B
of Annex ROAD.1
 
Compulsory periodic training courses must be organised by an approved training centre. Their
duration must be of 35 hours every five years, given in periods of at least seven hours, which may be
split over two consecutive days. Whenever e- learning is used, the approved training centre shall
ensure that the proper quality of the training is maintained, including by selecting the subjects
where ICT tools can most effectively be deployed. In particular, the Parties shall require reliable user


identification and appropriate means of control. The maximum duration of the e-learning training
shall not exceed 12 hours. At least one of the training course periods shall cover a road safety
related subject. The content of the training shall take into account training needs specific to the
transport operations carried out by the driver and relevant legal and technological developments
and should, as far as possible, take into account specific training needs of the driver. A range of
different subjects should be covered over the 35 hours, including repeat training where it is shown
that the driver needs specific remedial training.

A Party and, in the case of the Union, a Member State may count specific other training related to
the transport of goods by road required under its legislation as part of the training under this
Section.

 
Section 5: Approval of the initial qualification and periodic training
 
5.1. The training centres taking part in the initial qualification and periodic training must be
approved by the competent authorities in the Parties. Approval may be given only in response to a
written application. The application must be accompanied by documents including:

5.1.1. a suitable qualification and training programme specifying the subjects taught and
setting out the proposed implementing plan and teaching methods;

the driver is able to return before the start of the regular weekly rest period of more than 45 hours
taken in compensation.

The undertaking shall document how it fulfils that obligation and shall keep the documentation at its

from a vehicle which falls within the scope of this Section, which is not at the driver's home or at the
employer's operational centre where the driver is normally based, shall count as other work.


 
Article 7 - Liability of road haulage operators
 
1. A road haulage operator of a Party shall not give drivers it employs or who are put at its

travelled, the speed of delivery and/or the amount of goods carried if that payment is of such a kind
as to endanger road safety and/or encourages infringement of this Section.
2. A road haulage operator of a Party shall organise road transport operations and properly
instruct crew members so that they are able to comply with the provisions of this Section.

may consider any evidence that the road haulage operator cannot reasonably be held responsible
for the infringement committed.

4. Road haulage operators, consignors, freight forwarders, principal contractors,
subcontractors and driver employment agencies shall ensure that contractually agreed transport
time schedules respect this Section.

checks performed at the premises of undertakings covering a large and representative cross-section
of mobile workers, drivers, undertakings and vehicles of all transport categories falling within the
scope of those Sections.

The competent authorities in each Party shall organise the checks so that:

 
(i) during each calendar year, a minimum of 3% of the days worked by the drivers of
vehicles falling within the scope of Section 2 of Part B applies shall be checked; and
 
 
(ii) at least 30% of the total number of working days checked shall be checked at the
roadside and at least 50% at the premises of undertakings.
 
The elements of roadside checks shall include:

 
(i) daily and weekly driving periods, interruptions and daily and weekly rest periods;
 
 
(ii) the record sheets of the preceding days, which shall be on board the vehicle,
and/or the data stored for the same period on the driver card and/or in the
memory of the tachograph and/or on the printouts, when required; and
 
 
(iii) the correct functioning of the tachograph.
 
Those checks shall be carried out without discrimination among vehicles, undertakings and drivers
whether resident or not, and regardless of the origin or destination of the journey or type of
tachograph.

the organisation of drivers' working time.
 
2. If the findings of a roadside check on the driver of a vehicle registered in the territory of the
other Party provide grounds to believe that infringements have been committed which cannot be
detected during the check due to lack of necessary data, the competent authorities in each Party
shall assist each other to clarify the situation. In cases where, to that end, the competent authorities
in a Party carry out a check at the premises of the undertaking, the results of that check shall be
communicated to the competent authorities of the other Party.
3. The competent authorities in the Parties shall work in cooperation with each other in the
organisation of concerted roadside checks.


4. Each Party shall introduce a risk rating system for undertakings based on the relative
number and severity of any infringements, as set out in Appendix ROAD.A.1 and of any
infringements included in the list drawn up by the Specialised Committee on Road Transport under
Article 6(3) of Section 1 of Part A, that an individual undertaking has committed.

5, Undertakings with a high risk rating shall be checked more closely and more often.

6. Each Party and, in the case of the Union, each Member State, shall enable its competent
authorities to impose a penalty on a road haulage operator and/or a driver for an infringement of
the applicable provisions on driving time, breaks and rest periods detected on its territory and for
which a penalty has not already been imposed, even where that infringement has been committed
on the territory of the other Party or, in the case of the Union, the territory of a Member State or of
a third country.

— the distance (a) between the front of the motor vehicle and the centre of the
coupling device (coupling hook or fifth wheel); in the case of a fifth wheel with
several coupling points, the minimum and maximum values must be given (amin
and amax );
 
 
— the distance (b) between the centre of the coupling device of the trailer (fifth
wheel ring) or of the semi-trailer (king pin) and the rear of the trailer or of the
semi-trailer; in the case of a device with several coupling points, the minimum
and maximum values must be given (bmin and bmax ).
 
 
The length of vehicle combinations is the length of the motor vehicle and trailer
or semi-trailer placed in a straight line behind each other.
 
#### (b) a single plate containing the information on the two plates referred to in point (a); or

#### (c) a single document issued by the competent authorities of a Party or, in the case of the

 
Union, the Member State where the vehicle is registered or put into circulation containing
the same information as the plates referred to in point (a). It shall be kept in a place easily
accessible to inspection and shall be adequately protected.
 
#### 2. If the characteristics of the vehicle no longer correspond to those indicated on the proof of

 
compliance, the Party or, in the case of the Union, the Member State in which the vehicle is
registered or put into circulation shall take the necessary steps to ensure that the proof of
compliance is altered.
 
#### 3. The plates and documents referred to in paragraph 1 shall be recognised by the Parties as the proof

 
of vehicle compliance provided for in this Section.
 
 
Article 9 - Enforcement
 
#### 1. Each Party shall take specific measures to identify vehicles or vehicle combinations in circulation

 
that are likely to have exceeded the maximum authorised weight and that shall therefore be
checked by the competent authorities of the Parties in order to ensure compliance with the
requirements of this Section. This can be done with the aid of automatic systems set up on the
road infrastructure, or by means of on-board weighing equipment installed in vehicles. Such on-
board weighing equipment shall be accurate and reliable, fully interoperable and compatible with
all vehicle types.
 

#### 2. A Party shall not require on-board weighing equipment to be installed on vehicles or vehicle

 
combinations which are registered in the other Party.
 
#### 3. Where automatic systems are used to establish infringements of this Section and to impose

 
penalties, such automatic systems shall be certified. Where automatic systems are used only for
identification purposes, they need not be certified.
 
#### 4. The Parties shall, in accordance with Article 14 of Section 1 of Part A of this Annex, ensure that

 
their competent authorities exchange information about infringements and penalties relating to
this Article.

Article 9 - Issuing of driver cards
 
1. Driver cards shall be issued, at the request of the driver, by the competent authority in a
Party where the driver has his normal residence. Where the competent authorities in a Party issuing
the driver card have doubts as to the validity of a statement as to normal residence, or for the
purpose of certain specific controls, they may request any additional information or evidence from
the driver.

 
For the purposes of this Article, "normal residence" means the place where a person usually lives,
that is for at least 185 days in each calendar year, because of personal and occupational ties, or, in
the case of a person with no occupational ties, because of personal ties which show close links
between that person and the place where he is living.
 
 
However, the normal residence of a person whose occupational ties are in a place different from
their personal ties and who consequently lives in turn in different places situated in the two Parties
shall be regarded as being the place of their personal ties, provided that such person returns there
regularly. This last condition need not be complied with where the person is living in a Party in order
to carry out a fixed-term assignment.
 
2. In duly justified and exceptional cases, each Party or, in the case of the Union, a Member
State may issue a temporary and non-renewable driver card valid for a maximum period of 185 days
to a driver who does not have his normal residence in a Party, provided that such driver is in a labour
law relationship with an undertaking established in the issuing Party and, in so far, presents a driver
attestation when required.
3. The competent authorities of the issuing Party shall take appropriate measures to ensure
that an applicant does not already hold a valid driver card and shall personalise the driver card,
ensuring that its data are visible and secure.
4. The driver card shall not be valid for more than five years.
5. A valid driver card shall not be withdrawn or suspended unless the competent authorities of
a Party find that the card has been falsified, or the driver is using a card of which he is not the
holder, or the card held has been obtained on the basis of false declarations and/or forged
documents. If such suspension or withdrawal measures are taken by a Party or, in the case of the
Union, a Member State other than the issuing Party or, in the case of the Union, other than the
issuing Member State, the former shall return the card to the authorities of the Party or, in the case
of the Union, the authorities of the Member State which issued it, as soon as possible, indicating the
reasons for the withdrawal or suspension. If the return of the card is expected to take longer than
two weeks, the suspending or withdrawing Party or, in the case of the Union, the suspending or
withdrawing Member State shall inform the issuing Party or, in the case of the Union, the issuing
Member State within those two weeks of the reasons for suspension or withdrawal.


6. The competent authority of the issuing Party may require a driver to replace the driver card
by a new one if this is necessary to comply with the relevant technical specifications.
7. Each Party shall take all necessary measures to prevent driver cards from being falsified.
8. This Article shall not prevent a Party or, in the case of the Union, a Member State from
issuing a driver card to a driver who has his normal residence in a part of that Party's territory, to
which this Annex does not apply, provided that the relevant provisions of this Section are applied in
such cases.

 
Article 10 - Renewal of driver cards
 
#### 1. Where, in the case of renewals, the Party of the driver's normal residence is different from that

 
which issued his current card, and where the authorities of the former Party are requested to renew
the driver card, they shall inform the authorities which issued the earlier card of the reasons for its
renewal.
 
#### 2. In the event of a request for the renewal of a card which is imminently about to expire, the

 
competent authority shall supply a new card before the expiry date, provided that the request was
sent within the time-limits laid down in Article 5 of Section 4 of Part B of this Annex.
 
 
Article 11 - Stolen, lost or defective driver cards
 
#### 1. Issuing authorities shall keep records of issued, stolen, lost or defective driver cards for a period at

 
least equivalent to their period of validity.
 
#### 2. If the driver card is damaged, malfunctions or is lost or stolen, the competent authorities in the

 
Party of his normal residence shall supply a replacement card within eight working days after their
receipt of a detailed request to that effect.
 
 
Article 12 - Mutual acceptance of driver cards
 
#### 1. Each Party shall accept the driver cards issued by the other Party.

#### 2. Where the holder of a valid driver card issued by a Party has established his normal residence in

 
the other Party and has asked for his card to be exchanged for an equivalent driver card, it shall
be the responsibility of the Party or, in the case of the Union, the Member State which carries out
the exchange to verify whether the card produced is still valid.
 
#### 3. Parties or, in the case of the Union, Member States carrying out an exchange shall return the old

 
card to the authorities of the issuing Party or, in the case of the Union, the issuing Member State
and indicate the reasons for so doing.
 
#### 4. Where a Party or, in the case of the Union, a Member State replaces or exchanges a driver card,

 
the replacement or exchange, and any subsequent replacement or exchange, shall be registered
in that Party or, in the case of the Union, in that Member State.
 

 
Article 13 - Electronic exchange of information on driver cards
 
#### 1. In order to ensure that an applicant does not already hold a valid driver card, Parties or, in the case

 
of the Union, Member States shall maintain national electronic registers containing the following
information on driver cards for a period at least equivalent to the period of validity of those cards:
— surname and first name of the driver;
 
 
— birth date and, if available, place of birth of the driver;
 
 
— valid driving licence number and country of issue of the driving licence (if applicable);
 
 
— status of the driver card; and
 
 
— driver card number.
 
#### 2. The electronic registers of the Parties or, in the case of the Union, the Member States shall be

 
interconnected and accessible throughout the territory of the Parties, using the TACHOnet
messaging system or a compatible system. In the case of the use of a compatible system, the
exchange of electronic data with the other Party shall be possible through the TACHOnet messaging
system.
 
#### 3. When issuing, replacing and, where necessary, renewing a driver card, Parties or, in the case of the

 
Union, Member States shall verify through electronic data exchange that the driver does not already
hold another valid driver card. The data exchanged shall be limited to the data necessary for the
purpose of this verification.
 
#### 4. Control officers may have access to the electronic register in order to check the status of a driver

 
card.
 
 
Article 14 - Settings of tachographs
 
#### 1. Digital tachographs shall not be set in such a way that they automatically switch to a specific

 
category of activity when the vehicle's engine or ignition is switched off, unless the driver remains
able to choose manually the appropriate category of activity.
 
#### 2. Vehicles shall not be fitted with more than one tachograph, except for the purposes of field tests.

#### 3. Each Party shall forbid the production, distribution, advertising and/or selling of devices constructed

 
and/or intended for the manipulation of tachographs.
 
 
Article 15 - Responsibility of road haulage operators
 
#### 1. Road haulage operators shall be responsible for ensuring that their drivers are properly trained and

 
instructed as regards the correct functioning of tachographs, whether digital, smart or analogue,
shall make regular checks to ensure that their drivers make correct use thereof, and shall not give to
their drivers any direct or indirect incentives that could encourage the misuse of tachographs.
 
 
Road haulage operators shall issue a sufficient number of record sheets to drivers of vehicles fitted
with analogue tachographs, taking into account the fact that record sheets are personal in character,
 

 
the length of the period of service and the possible need to replace record sheets which are
damaged or have been taken by an authorised control officer. Road haulage operators shall issue to
drivers only record sheets of an approved model suitable for use in the equipment installed in the
vehicle.
 
 
The road haulage operator shall ensure that, taking into account the length of the period of service,
the printing of data from the tachograph at the request of a control officer can be carried out
correctly in the event of an inspection.
 
#### 2. Road haulage operators shall keep record sheets and printouts, whenever printouts have been made

 
to comply with Article 9 of Section 4 of Part B of this Annex, in chronological order and in a legible
form, for at least a year after their use, and shall give copies to the drivers concerned who request
them. Road haulage operators shall also give copies of data downloaded from driver cards to the
drivers concerned who request them, together with printed paper versions of those copies. Record
sheets, printouts and downloaded data shall be produced or handed over at the request of any
authorised control officer.
 
#### 3. Road haulage operators shall be liable for infringements of this Section and of Section 4 of Part B of

 
this Annex committed by their drivers or by drivers at their disposal. However, each Party may make
such liability conditional on the road haulage operator's infringement of the first subparagraph of
paragraph 1 of this Article and Article 7(1) and (2) of Section 2 of Part B of this Annex.
 
 
Article 16 - Procedures for road haulage operators in the event of malfunctioning equipment
 
#### 1. In the event of the breakdown or faulty operation of a tachograph, the road haulage operator shall

 
have it repaired by an approved fitter or workshop, as soon as circumstances permit.
 
#### 2. If the vehicle is unable to return to the road haulage operator's premises within a period of one

 
week calculated from the day of the breakdown or of the discovery of defective operation, the
repair shall be carried out en route.
 
#### 3. Each Party or, in the case of the Union, the Member States shall give the competent authorities

 
power to prohibit the use of the vehicle in cases where the breakdown or faulty operation has not
been remedied as provided in paragraphs 1 and 2 in so far as this is in accordance with the national
legislation in the Party concerned.
 
 
Article 17 - Procedure for the issuing of tachograph cards

##### ANNEX FISH.4: PROTOCOL ON ACCESS TO WATERS

The United Kingdom and the Union

AFFIRMING the sovereign rights and obligations of independent coastal States exercised by the
Parties;

EMPHASISING that the right of each Party to grant vessels of the other Party access to fish in its
waters is ordinarily to be exercised in annual consultations following the determination of TACs for a
given year in annual consultations;

NOTING the social and economic benefits of a further period of stability, during which fishers would
be permitted until 30 June 2026 to continue to access the waters of the other Party as before the
entry into force of this Agreement;

HAVE AGREED as follows:

 
Article 1
 
An adjustment period is hereby established. The adjustment period shall last from 1 January 2021
until 30 June 2026.

 
Article 2
 
1. By derogation from Article FISH.8(1), (3), (4), (5), (6) and (7) [Access to waters] of Heading V
[Fisheries], during the adjustment period each Party shall grant to vessels of the other Party full
access to its waters to fish:

(a) stocks listed in Annex FISH.1 and Annex FISH.2A, B and F at a level that is reasonably
commensurate with the Parties respective shares of the fishing opportunities;

(b) non quota stocks at a level that equates to the average tonnage fished by that Party in the
waters of the other Party during the period 2012-2016;

(c) for qualifying vessels to the zone in the waters of the Parties between six and twelve nautical
miles from the baselines in ICES divisions 4c and 7d-g to the extent that each Party’s qualifying
vessels had access to that zone on 31 December 2020.

For the purposes of this point, “qualifying vessel” means a vessel of a Party, which fished in the zone
mentioned in the previous sentence in at least four years between 2012 and 2016, or its direct
replacement.

2. The Parties shall notify the other Party of any change in the level and conditions of access to
waters that will apply from 1 July 2026.
3. Article 9[Compensatory measures in case of withdrawal or reduction of access] shall apply
_mutatis_ mutandis in relation to any change under paragraph 2 of this Article in respect of the period
from 1 July 2026 to 31 December 2026.

1. Processing of personal data by the receiving State shall be permitted solely for the purposes

for which the data have been supplied in accordance with Title II [Exchanges of DNA, Fingerprints

and vehicle registration data] of Part Three. Processing for other purposes shall be permitted solely

with the prior authorisation of the State administering the file and subject only to the domestic law

of the receiving State. Such authorisation may be granted provided that processing for such other

purposes is permitted under the domestic law of the State administering the file.

2. Processing of data supplied pursuant to Articles LAW.PRUM.8 [Automated searching of DNA

profiles], LAW.PRUM.9 [Automated comparison of DNA profiles] and LAW.PRUM.12 [Automated

searching of dactyloscopic data] by the searching or comparing State shall be permitted solely in

order to:

(a) establish whether the compared DNA profiles or dactyloscopic data match;

(b) prepare and submit a police or judicial request for legal assistance in compliance with

 
domestic law if those data match;
 
(c) record within the meaning of Article 19 of this Chapter.

3. The State administering the file may process the data supplied to it in accordance with

Articles LAW.PRUM.8 [Automated searching of DNA profiles], LAW.PRUM.9 [Automated comparison

of DNA profiles] and LAW.PRUM.12 [Automated searching of dactyloscopic data] solely where this is

necessary for the purposes of comparison, providing automated replies to searches or recording

pursuant to Article 19 of this Chapter. The supplied data shall be deleted immediately following data

comparison or automated replies to searches unless further processing is necessary for the purposes

referred to in points (b) and (c) of paragraph 2 of this Article.

4. Data supplied in accordance with Article.LAW.PRUM.15 [Automated searching of vehicle

registration data] may be used by the State administering the file solely where this is necessary for

the purpose of providing automated replies to search procedures or recording pursuant to Article 19

of this Chapter. The data supplied shall be deleted immediately following automated replies to


_This document has been agreed between the European Union and the United Kingdom and is provided for information only.
No rights may be derived from it until the date of application. The numbering of the articles is provisional._

searches unless further processing is necessary for recording pursuant to Article 19 of this Chapter.

The Member State may use data received in a reply solely for the procedure for which the search

was made.

 
Article 17: Accuracy, current relevance and storage time of data
 
1. The States shall ensure the accuracy and current relevance of personal data. The receiving

State shall be notified without delay if it transpires ex officio, or from a notification by the data

subject, that incorrect data or data which should not have been supplied have been supplied. The

State(s) concerned shall be obliged to correct or delete the data. Moreover, personal data supplied

shall be corrected if they are found to be incorrect. If the receiving body has reason to believe that

the supplied data are incorrect or should be deleted, the supplying body shall be informed forthwith.

2. Data, the accuracy of which the data subject contests and the accuracy or inaccuracy of

which cannot be established shall, in accordance with the domestic law of the States, be marked

with a flag at the request of the data subject. If a flag exists, this may be removed subject to the

domestic law of the States and only with the permission of the data subject or on the basis of a

decision of the competent court or independent data protection authority.

3. Personal data supplied which should not have been supplied or received shall be deleted.

Data which are lawfully supplied and received shall be deleted:

(a) if they are not or no longer necessary for the purpose for which they were supplied; if

 
personal data have been supplied without request, the receiving body shall immediately check
if they are necessary for the purposes for which they were supplied;
 
(b) following the expiry of the maximum period for keeping data laid down in the domestic law of

 
the supplying State, where the supplying body informed the receiving body of that maximum
period at the time of supplying the data.
 
4. Where there is reason to believe that deletion would prejudice the interests of the data

subject, the data shall be blocked instead of being deleted in compliance with domestic law. Blocked

data may be supplied or used solely for the purpose which prevented their deletion.

 
Article 18: Technical and organisational measures to ensure data protection and data security
 
1. The supplying and receiving bodies shall take steps to ensure that personal data is effectively

protected against accidental or unauthorised destruction, accidental loss, unauthorised access,

unauthorised or accidental alteration and unauthorised disclosure.

2. The features of the technical specification of the automated search procedure are regulated

in the implementing measures as referred to in Article LAW.PRUM.17 [Implementing measures]

which guarantee that:

(a) state-of-the-art technical measures are taken to ensure data protection and data security, in

 
particular data confidentiality and integrity;
 

_This document has been agreed between the European Union and the United Kingdom and is provided for information only.

(b) encryption and authorisation procedures recognised by the competent authorities are used

 
when having recourse to generally accessible networks; and
 
(c) the admissibility of searches in accordance with paragraphs 2, 5 and 6 of Article 19 of this

 
Chapter can be checked.
 
 
Article 19: Logging and recording: special rules governing automated and non-automated supply
 
1. Each State shall guarantee that every non-automated supply and every non-automated

receipt of personal data by the body administering the file and by the searching body is logged in

order to verify the admissibility of the supply. Logging shall contain the following information:

(a) the reason for the supply;

(b) the data supplied;

(c) the date of the supply; and

(d) the name or reference code of the searching body and of the body administering the file.

2. The following shall apply to automated searches for data based on Articles LAW.PRUM.8

[Automated searching of DNA profiles], LAW.PRUM.12 [Automated searching of dactyloscopic data]

4. The recording body shall immediately communicate the recorded data upon request to the

competent data protection authorities of the relevant State at the latest within four weeks following

receipt of the request; recorded data may be used solely for the following purposes:

(a) monitoring data protection;

(b) ensuring data security.

5. The recorded data shall be protected with suitable measures against inappropriate use and

other forms of improper use and shall be kept for two years. After the conservation period, the

recorded data shall be deleted immediately.

6. Responsibility for legal checks on the supply or receipt of personal data lies with the

independent data protection authorities or, as appropriate, the judicial authorities of the respective

States. Anyone can request those authorities to check the lawfulness of the processing of data in

respect of their person in compliance with domestic law. Independently of such requests, those

authorities and the bodies responsible for recording shall carry out random checks on the lawfulness

of supply, based on the files involved.

7. The results of such checks shall be kept for inspection for 18 months by the independent

data protection authorities. After that period, they shall be immediately deleted. Each data

protection authority may be requested by the independent data protection authority of another

State to exercise its powers in accordance with domestic law. The independent data protection

authorities of the States shall perform the inspection tasks necessary for mutual cooperation, in

particular by exchanging relevant information.

 
Article 20: Data subjects' rights to damages
 
Where a body of one State has supplied personal data under Title II [Exchanges of DNA, Fingerprints
and vehicle registration data] of Part Three, the receiving body of the other State cannot use the
inaccuracy of the data supplied as grounds to evade its liability vis-à-vis the injured party under
domestic law. If damages are awarded against the receiving body because of its use of inaccurate
transfer data, the body which supplied the data shall refund the amount paid in damages to the
receiving body in full.

 
Article 21: Information requested by the States
 
The receiving State shall inform the supplying State on request of the processing of supplied data
and the result obtained.

CHAPTER 1: Exchange of DNA-data
 
1. DNA related forensic issues, matching rules and algorithms

1.1. Properties of DNA-profiles

The DNA profile may contain 24 pairs of numbers representing the alleles of 24 loci which are also
used in the DNA-procedures of Interpol. The names of those loci are provided in the following table:

VWA TH01 D21S11 FGA D8S1179 D3S1358 D18S 51 Amelogeni

 
n
 
##### TPOX CSF1P0 D13S317 D7S820 D5S818 D16S539 D2S1338 D19S433

Penta D Penta E FES F13A1 F13B SE33 CD4 GABA

The seven grey loci in the top row are both the present ESS and the ISSOL.

Inclusion Rules:

The DNA-profiles made available by the States for searching and comparison as well as the DNA-
profiles sent out for searching and comparison shall contain at least six full designated^147 loci and
may contain additional loci or blanks depending on their availability. The reference DNA profiles shall
contain at least six of the seven ESS of loci. In order to raise the accuracy of matches, all available
alleles shall be stored in the indexed DNA profile database and be used for searching and
comparison. Each State should implement as soon as practically possible any new ESS of loci
adopted by the EU.

Mixed profiles are not allowed, so that the allele values of each locus will consist of only two
numbers, which may be the same in the case of homozygosity at a given locus.

Wild-cards and Micro-variants are to be dealt with using the following rules:

- Any non-numerical value except amelogenin contained in the profile (e.g. ‘o’, ‘f’, ‘r’, ‘na’,

 
‘nr’ or ‘un’) has to be automatically converted for the export to a wild card (*) and
searched against all,
 
- Numerical values ‘0’, ‘1’ or ‘99’ contained in the profile have to be automatically converted

 
for the export to a wild card (*) and searched against all,
 
- If three alleles are provided for one locus the first allele will be accepted and the remaining

 
two alleles have to be automatically converted for the export to a wild card (*) and
searched against all,
 
(^147) ‘Full designated’ means the handling of rare allelle values is included.


_This document has been agreed between the European Union and the United Kingdom and is provided for information only.
No rights may be derived from it until the date of application. The numbering of the articles is provisional._

- When wild card values are provided for allele 1 or 2 then both permutations of the

 
numerical value given for the locus will be searched (e.g. 12, * could match against 12,14
or 9,12),
 
- Pentanucleotide (Penta D, Penta E and CD4) micro-variants will be matched according to

 
the following:
 
x.1 = x, x.1, x.2

x.2 = x.1, x.2, x.3

x.3 = x.2, x.3, x.4

x.4 = x.3, x.4, x + 1,

- Tetranucleotide (the rest of the loci are tetranucleotides) micro-variants will be matched

 
according to the following:
 
x.1 = x, x.1, x.2

x.2 = x.1, x.2, x.3

x.3 = x.2, x.3, x + 1.

1.2. Matching rules

The comparison of two DNA-profiles will be performed on the basis of the loci for which a pair of
allele values is available in both DNA-profiles. At least six full designated loci (exclusive of
amelogenin) must match between both DNA-profiles before a HIT response is provided.

A full match (Quality 1) is defined as a match, when all allele values of the compared loci commonly
contained in the requesting and requested DNA-profiles are the same. A near match is defined as a
match, when the value of only one of all the compared alleles is different in the two DNA profiles
(Quality 2, 3 and 4). A near match is only accepted if there are at least six full designated matched
loci in the two compared DNA profiles.

The reason for a near match may be:

- a human typing error at the point of entry of one of the DNA-profiles in the search request

 
or the DNA-database,
 
- an allele-determination or allele-calling error during the generation procedure of the DNA-

 
profile.
 
1.3. Reporting rules

Full matches, near matches and ‘No-HITs’ will all be reported.


_This document has been agreed between the European Union and the United Kingdom and is provided for information only.
No rights may be derived from it until the date of application. The numbering of the articles is provisional._

The matching report will be sent to the requesting national contact point and will also be made
available to the requested national contact point (to enable it to estimate the nature and number of
possible follow-up requests for further available personal data and other information associated
with the DNA-profile corresponding to the HIT in accordance with Article LAW.PRUM.14 [Supply of
further personal data and other information].

2. State code number table

In accordance with Title II [Exchanges of DNA, Fingerprints and vehicle registration data] of Part
Three, ISO 3166- 1 alpha-2 code are used for setting up the domain names and other configuration
parameters required in the Prüm DNA data exchange applications over a closed network.

ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 codes are the following two-letter State codes:

 
State names Code State names Code
 
 
Belgium BE Lithuania LT
 
 
Bulgaria BG Luxemburg LU

3. Functional analysis

3.1. Availability of the system


_This document has been agreed between the European Union and the United Kingdom and is provided for information only.
No rights may be derived from it until the date of application. The numbering of the articles is provisional._

Requests pursuant to Article LAW.PRUM.8 [Automated searching of DNA profiles] should reach the
targeted database in the chronological order that each request was sent; responses should be
dispatched to reach the requesting State within 15 minutes of the arrival of requests.

3.2. Second step

When a State receives a report of a match, its national contact point is responsible for comparing
the values of the profile submitted as a question and the values of the profile(s) received as an
answer to validate and check the evidential value of the profile. National contact points can contact
each other directly for validation purposes.

Legal assistance procedures start after validation of an existing match between two profiles, on the
basis of a ‘full match’ or a ‘near match’ obtained during the automated consultation phase.

4. DNA interface control document

4.1. Introduction

4.1.1. _Objectives_

This Chapter defines the requirements for the exchange of DNA profile information between the
DNA database systems of all States. The header fields are defined specifically for the Prüm DNA
exchange; the data part is based on the DNA profile data part in the XML schema defined for the
Interpol DNA exchange gateway.

Data are exchanged by Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) and other state-of-the-art
technologies, using a central relay mail server provided by the network provider. The XML file is
transported as mail body.

4.1.2. _Scope_

This ICD defines the content of the message (or ‘mail’) only. All network-specific and mail-specific
topics are defined uniformly in order to allow a common technical base for the DNA data exchange.

This includes:

- the format of the subject field in the message to enable/allow for an automated processing

 
of the messages,
 
- whether content encryption is necessary and if yes which methods should be chosen,
- the maximum length of messages.

4.1.3. _XML structure and principles_

The XML message is structured into:

- the header part, which contains information about the transmission, and
- the data part, which contains profile specific information, as well as the profile itself.


_This document has been agreed between the European Union and the United Kingdom and is provided for information only.
No rights may be derived from it until the date of application. The numbering of the articles is provisional._

The same XML schema shall be used for request and response.

For the purpose of complete checks of unidentified DNA profiles, as provided for in Article
LAW.PRUM.9 [Automated comparison of DNA profiles], it shall be possible to send a batch of
profiles in one message. A maximum number of profiles within one message must be defined. The
number depends on the maximum allowed mail size and shall be defined after selection of the mail
server.

XML example:

<?version=“1.0” standalone=“yes”?>

<PRUEMDNAx xmlns:msxsl=“urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt”

xmlns:xsi=“http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance”>

5. Application, security and communication architecture

5.1. Overview

In implementing applications for the DNA data exchange within the framework of Title II [Exchanges
of DNA, Fingerprints and vehicle registration data] of Part Three, a common communication network
shall be used, which will be logically closed among the States. In order to exploit this common
communication infrastructure of sending requests and receiving replies in a more effective way, an
asynchronous mechanism to convey DNA and dactyloscopic data requests in a wrapped SMTP e-mail
message is adopted. In fulfilment of security concerns, the mechanism s/MIME as extension to the
SMTP functionality will be used to establish a true end-to-end secure tunnel over the network.

The operational Trans European Services for Telematics between Administrations (TESTA) is used as
the communication network for data exchange among the States. TESTA is under the responsibility
of the European Commission. Taking into account that national DNA databases and the current
national access points of TESTA may be located on different sites in the States, access to TESTA may
be set up either by:

1. using the existing national access point or establishing a new national TESTA access

 
point; or
 
2. setting up a secure local link from the site where the DNA database is located and

 
managed by the competent national agency to the existing national TESTA access point.
 
The protocols and standards deployed in the implementation of Title II [Exchanges of DNA,
Fingerprints and vehicle registration data] of Part Three applications comply with the open standards
and meet the requirements imposed by national security policy makers of the States.

5.2. Upper Level Architecture

In the scope of Title II [Exchanges of DNA, Fingerprints and vehicle registration data] of Part Three,
each State will make its DNA data available to be exchanged with and/or searched by other States in
conformity with the standardised common data format. The architecture is based upon an any-to-
any communication model. There exists neither a central computer server nor a centralised
database to hold DNA profiles.

No rights may be derived from it until the date of application. The numbering of the articles is provisional._

In addition to the fulfilment of domestic legal constraints at States' sites, each State may decide
what kind of hardware and software should be deployed for the configuration at its site to comply
with the requirements set out in Title II [Exchanges of DNA, Fingerprints and vehicle registration
data] of Part Three.

5.3. Security Standards and Data Protection

Three levels of security concerns have been considered and implemented.

5.3.1. _Data Level_

DNA profile data provided by each State shall have to be prepared in compliance with a common
data protection standard, so that requesting States will receive an answer mainly to indicate HIT or
No-HIT along with an identification number in case of a HIT, which does not contain any personal
information. The further investigation after the notification of a HIT will be conducted at bilateral
level pursuant to the existing domestic legal and organisational regulations of the respective States'
sites.

5.3.2. _Communication Level_

Messages containing DNA profile information (requesting and replying) will be encrypted by means
of a state-of-the-art mechanism in conformity with open standards, such as s/MIME, before they are
forwarded to the sites of other States.

5.3.3. _Transmission Level_

All encrypted messages containing DNA profile information will be forwarded onto other States'
sites through a virtual private tunnelling system administered by a trusted network provider at the


_This document has been agreed between the European Union and the United Kingdom and is provided for information only.
No rights may be derived from it until the date of application. The numbering of the articles is provisional._

international level and the secure links to this tunnelling system under national responsibility. This
virtual private tunnelling system does not have a connection point with the open Internet.

5.4. Protocols and Standards to be used for encryption mechanism: s/MIME and related

packages

The open standard s/MIME as extension to de facto e-mail standard SMTP will be deployed to
encrypt messages containing DNA profile information. The protocol s/MIME (V3) allows signed
receipts, security labels, and secure mailing lists and is layered on Cryptographic Message Syntax
(CMS), an Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) specification for cryptographic protected messages.
It can be used to digitally sign, digest, authenticate or encrypt any form of digital data.

The underlying certificate used by the s/MIME mechanism has to be in compliance with X.509
standard. In order to ensure common standards and procedures with other Prüm applications, the
processing rules for s/MIME encryption operations or to be applied under various Commercial
Product of the Shelves (COTS) environments, are as follows:

- the sequence of the operations is: first encryption and then signing,
- the encryption algorithm AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) with 256 bit key length and

 
RSA with 1024 bit key length shall be applied for symmetric and asymmetric encryption
respectively,
 
- the hash algorithm SHA-1 shall be applied.

s/MIME functionality is built into the vast majority of modern e-mail software packages including
Outlook, Mozilla Mail as well as Netscape Communicator 4.x and inter-operates among all major e-
mail software packages.

Because of s/MIME's easy integration into national IT infrastructure at all States' sites, it is selected
as a viable mechanism to implement the communication security level. For achieving the goal 'Proof
of Concept' in a more efficient way and reducing costs the open standard JavaMail API is however
chosen for prototyping DNA data exchange. JavaMail API provides simple encryption and decryption
of e-mails using s/MIME and/or OpenPGP. The intent is to provide a single, easy-to-use API for e-
mail clients that want to send and receive encrypted e-mail in either of the two most popular e-mail
encryption formats. Therefore any state-of-the-art implementations to JavaMail API will suffice for
the requirements set by Title II [Exchanges of DNA, Fingerprints and vehicle registration data] of Part
Three, such as the product of Bouncy Castle JCE (Java Cryptographic Extension), which will be used
to implement s/MIME for prototyping DNA data exchange among all States.

5.5. Application Architecture

Each State will provide the other States with a set of standardised DNA profile data which are in
conformity with the current common ICD. This can be done either by providing a logical view over
individual national database or by establishing a physical exported database (indexed database).

The four main components: E-mail server/s/MIME, Application Server, Data Structure Area for
fetching/feeding data and registering incoming/outgoing messages, and Match Engine implement
the whole application logic in a product-independent way.


_This document has been agreed between the European Union and the United Kingdom and is provided for information only.
No rights may be derived from it until the date of application. The numbering of the articles is provisional._

In order to provide all States with an easy integration of the components into their respective
national sites, the specified common functionality has been implemented by means of open source
components, which could be selected by each State depending on its national IT policy and
regulations. Because of the independent features to be implemented to get access to indexed
databases containing DNA profiles covered by Title II [Exchanges of DNA, Fingerprints and vehicle
registration data] of Part Three, each State can freely select its hardware and software platform,
including database and operating systems.

A prototype for the DNA Data Exchange has been developed and successfully tested over the
existing common network. The version 1.0 has been deployed in the productive environment and is
used for daily operations. States may use the jointly developed product but may also develop their
own products. The common product components will be maintained, customised and further
developed according to changing IT, forensic and/or functional police requirements.

 
Figure 2: Overview Application Topology
 
5.6. Protocols and Standards to be used for application architecture:

##### 5.6.1. XML

The DNA data exchange will fully exploit XML-schema as attachment to SMTP e-mail messages. The
eXtensible Markup Language (XML) is a W3C-recommended general-purpose markup language for
creating special-purpose markup languages, capable of describing many different kinds of data. The
description of the DNA profile suitable for exchange among all States has been done by means of
XML and XML schema in the ICD document.

5.6.2. _ODBC_

Open DataBase Connectivity provides a standard software API method for accessing database
management systems and making it independent of programming languages, database and
operating systems. ODBC has, however, certain drawbacks. Administering a large number of client
machines can involve a diversity of drivers and DLLs. This complexity can increase system
administration overhead.

5.6.3. _JDBC_


_This document has been agreed between the European Union and the United Kingdom and is provided for information only.
No rights may be derived from it until the date of application. The numbering of the articles is provisional._

Java DataBase Connectivity (JDBC) is an API for the Java programming language that defines how a
client may access a database. In contrast to ODBC, JDBC does not require to use a certain set of local
DLLs at the Desktop.

The business logic of processing DNA profile requests and replies at each States' site is described in
the following diagram. Both requesting and replying flows interact with a neutral data area
comprising different data pools with a common data structure.

 
Figure 3: Overview Application Workflow at each State's site
 
5.7. Communication Environment

5.7.1. _Common Communication Network: TESTA and its follow-up infrastructure_

The application DNA data exchange will exploit the e-mail, an asynchronous mechanism, to send
requests and to receive replies among the States. As all States have at least one national access
point to the TESTA network, the DNA data exchange will be deployed over the TESTA network.
TESTA provides a number of added-value services through its e-mail relay. In addition to hosting
TESTA specific e-mail boxes, the infrastructure can implement mail distribution lists and routing
policies. This allows TESTA to be used as a clearing house for messages addressed to administrations
connected to the EU wide Domains. Virus check mechanisms may also be put in place.

The TESTA e-mail relay is built on a high availability hardware platform located at the central TESTA
application facilities and protected by firewall. The TESTA Domain Name Systems (DNS) will resolve
resource locators to IP addresses and hide addressing issues from the user and from applications.

5.7.2. _Security Concern_

The concept of a Virtual Private Network (VPN) has been implemented within the framework of
TESTA. Tag Switching Technology used to build this VPN will evolve to support Multi-Protocol Label
Switching (MPLS) standard developed by the IETF.


_This document has been agreed between the European Union and the United Kingdom and is provided for information only.
No rights may be derived from it until the date of application. The numbering of the articles is provisional._

MPLS is an IETF standard technology that speeds up network traffic flow by avoiding packet analysis
by intermediate routers (hops). This is done on the basis of so-called labels that are attached to
packet by the edge routers of the backbone, on the basis of information stored in the forwarding
information base (FIB). Labels are also used to implement VPNs.

MPLS combines the benefits of layer 3 routing with the advantages of layer 2 switching. Because IP
addresses are not evaluated during transition through the backbone, MPLS does not impose any IP
addressing limitations.

Furthermore, e-mail messages over the TESTA will be protected by s/MIME driven encryption
mechanism. Without knowing the key and possessing the right certificate, nobody can decrypt
messages over the network.

5.7.3. _Protocols and Standards to be used over the communication network_

##### 5.7.3.1. SMTP

SMTP is the de facto standard for e-mail transmission across the Internet. SMTP is a relatively
simple, text-based protocol, where one or more recipients of a message are specified and then the
message text is transferred. SMTP uses TCP port 25 upon the specification by the IETF. To determine
the SMTP server for a given domain name, the MX (Mail eXchange) DNS (Domain Name Systems)
record is used.

Since this protocol started as purely ASCII text-based it did not deal well with binary files. Standards
such as MIME were developed to encode binary files for transfer through SMTP. Today, most SMTP
servers support the 8BITMIME and s/MIME extension, permitting binary files to be transmitted
almost as easily as plain text. The processing rules for s/MIME operations are described in the
section s/MIME (see Section 5.4).


_This document has been agreed between the European Union and the United Kingdom and is provided for information only.
No rights may be derived from it until the date of application. The numbering of the articles is provisional._

SMTP is a ‘push’ protocol that does not allow one to ‘pull’ messages from a remote server on
demand. To do this a mail client shall use POP3 or IMAP. Within the framework of implementing
DNA data exchange it is decided to use the protocol POP3.

5.7.3.2. POP

Local e-mail clients use the Post Office Protocol version 3 (POP3), an application-layer Internet
standard protocol, to retrieve e-mail from a remote server over a TCP/IP connection. By using the
SMTP Submit profile of the SMTP protocol, e-mail clients send messages across the Internet or over
a corporate network. MIME serves as the standard for attachments and non-ASCII text in e-mail.
Although neither POP3 nor SMTP requires MIME-formatted e-mail, essentially Internet e-mail comes
MIME-formatted, so POP clients must also understand and use MIME. The whole communication
environment of Title II [Exchanges of DNA, Fingerprints and vehicle registration data] of Part Three
will therefore include the components of POP.

5.7.4. _Network Address Assignment_

Operative environment

A dedicated block half B class subnet has currently been allocated by the European IP registration
authority (RIPE) to TESTA. The assignment of IP addresses to States is based upon a geographical
schema in Europe. The data exchange among States within the framework of Title II [Exchanges of
DNA, Fingerprints and vehicle registration data ] of Part Three is operated over a European wide
logically closed IP network.

Testing Environment

In order to provide a smooth running environment for the daily operation among all connected
States, it is necessary to establish a testing environment over the closed network for new States
which prepare to join the operations. A sheet of parameters including IP addresses, network
settings, e-mail domains as well as application user accounts has been specified and should be set up
at the corresponding State's site. Moreover, a set of pseudo DNA profiles has been constructed for
test purposes.

5.7.5. _Configuration Parameters_

A secure e-mail system is set up using the eu-admin.net domain. That domain with the associated
addresses will not be accessible from a location not on the TESTA EU wide domain, because the
names are only known on the TESTA central DNS server, which is shielded from the Internet.

The mapping of these TESTA site addresses (host names) to their IP addresses is done by the TESTA
DNS service. For each Local Domain, a Mail entry will be added to this TESTA central DNS server,
relaying all e-mail messages sent to TESTA Local Domains to the TESTA central Mail Relay. That
TESTA central Mail Relay will then forward them to the specific Local Domain e-mail server using the
Local Domain e-mail addresses. By relaying the e-mail in this way, critical information contained in e-
mails will only pass the Europe-wide closed network infrastructure and not the insecure Internet.

It is necessary to establish sub-domains ( _bold italics_ ) at the sites of all States upon the following
syntax:


_This document has been agreed between the European Union and the United Kingdom and is provided for information only.
No rights may be derived from it until the date of application. The numbering of the articles is provisional._

‘application-type.State-code.pruem.testa.eu’, where:

‘ _State-code_ ’ takes the value of one of the two letter-code State codes (i.e. AT, BE, etc.);

‘ _application-type_ ’ takes one of the values: DNA, FP and CAR.

By applying the above syntax, the sub domains for the States are shown in the following table:

CHAPTER 2: Exchange of dactyloscopic data (interface control document)
 
The purpose of the following document interface Control Document is to define the requirements
for the exchange of dactyloscopic information between the Automated Fingerprint Identification
Systems (AFIS) of the States. It is based on the Interpol-Implementation of ANSI/NIST-ITL 1- 2000
(INT-I, Version 4.22b).

This version shall cover all basic definitions for Logical Records Type-1, Type-2, Type-4, Type-9, Type-
13 and Type-15 required for image- and minutiæ-based dactyloscopic processing.

1. File Content Overview

A dactyloscopic file consists of several logical records. There are sixteen types of record specified in
the original ANSI/NIST-ITL 1-2000 standard. Appropriate ASCII separation characters are used
between each record and the fields and subfields within the records.

Only 6 record types are used to exchange information between the originating and the destination
agency:

 
Type- 1 → Transaction information
 
 
Type- 2 → Alphanumeric persons/case data
 
 
Type- 4 → High resolution greyscale dactyloscopic images
 
 
Type- 9 → Minutiæ Record
 
 
Type- 13 → Variable resolution latent image record
 
 
Type- 15 → Variable resolution palmprint image record
 
1.1. Type- 1 — File header


_This document has been agreed between the European Union and the United Kingdom and is provided for information only.
No rights may be derived from it until the date of application. The numbering of the articles is provisional._

This record contains routing information and information describing the structure of the rest of the
file. This record type also defines the types of transaction which fall under the following broad
categories:

1.2. Type- 2 — Descriptive text

This record contains textual information of interest to the sending and receiving agencies.

1.3. Type- 4 — High resolution greyscale image

This record is used to exchange high resolution greyscale (eight bit) dactyloscopic images sampled at
500 pixels/inch. The dactyloscopic images shall be compressed using the WSQ algorithm with a ratio
of not more than 15:1. Other compression algorithms or uncompressed images shall not be used.

1.4. Type- 9 — Minutiæ record

Type-9 records are used to exchange ridge characteristics or minutiæ data. Their purpose is partly to
avoid unnecessary duplication of AFIS encoding processes and partly to allow the transmission of
AFIS codes which contain less data than the corresponding images.

1.5. Type- 13 — Variable-Resolution Latent Image Record

This record shall be used to exchange variable-resolution latent fingerprint and latent palmprint
images together with textural alphanumerical information. The scanning resolution of the images
shall be 500 pixels/inch with 256 grey-levels. If the quality of the latent image is sufficient it shall be
compressed using WSQ-algorithm. If necessary the resolution of the images may be expanded to
more than 500 pixels/inch and more than 256 grey-levels by mutual agreement. In that case, it is
strongly recommended to use JPEG 2000 (see Appendix 7).

1.6. Variable-Resolution Palmprint Image Record

Type-15 tagged field image records shall be used to exchange variable-resolution palmprint images
together with textural alphanumerical information. The scanning resolution of the images shall be
500 pixels/inch with 256 grey-levels. To minimise the amount of data, all palmprint images shall be
compressed using WSQ-algorithm. If necessary the resolution of the images may be expanded to
more than 500 pixels/inch and more than 256 grey-levels by mutual agreement. In that case, it is
strongly recommended to use JPEG 2000 (see Appendix 7).

2. Record format

A transaction file shall consist of one or more logical records. For each logical record contained in the
file, several information fields appropriate to that record type shall be present. Each information
field may contain one or more basic single-valued information items. Taken together these items are
used to convey different aspects of the data contained in that field. An information field may also
consist of one or more information items grouped together and repeated multiple times within a
field. Such a group of information items is known as a subfield. An information field may therefore
consist of one or more subfields of information items.

2.1. Information separators


_This document has been agreed between the European Union and the United Kingdom and is provided for information only.
No rights may be derived from it until the date of application. The numbering of the articles is provisional._

In the tagged-field logical records, mechanisms for delimiting information are implemented by use of
four ASCII information separators. The delimited information may be items within a field or subfield,
fields within a logical record, or multiple occurrences of subfields. These information separators are
defined in the standard ANSI X3.4. These characters are used to separate and qualify information in
a logical sense. Viewed in a hierarchical relationship, the File Separator ‘FS’ character is the most
inclusive followed by the Group Separator ‘GS’, the Record Separator ‘RS’, and finally the Unit
Separator ‘US’ characters. Table 1 lists these ASCII separators and a description of their use within
this standard.

Information separators should be functionally viewed as an indication of the type data that follows.
The ‘US’ character shall separate individual information items within a field or subfield. This is a
signal that the next information item is a piece of data for that field or subfield. Multiple subfields
within a field separated by the ‘RS’ character signals the start of the next group of repeated
information item(s). The ‘GS’ separator character used between information fields signals the
beginning of a new field preceding the field identifying number that shall appear. Similarly, the
beginning of a new logical record shall be signalled by the appearance of the ‘FS’ character.

The four characters are only meaningful when used as separators of data items in the fields of the
ASCII text records. There is no specific meaning attached to these characters occurring in binary
image records and binary fields — they are just part of the exchanged data.

Normally, there should be no empty fields or information items and therefore only one separator
character should appear between any two data items. The exception to this rule occurs for those
instances where the data in fields or information items in a transaction are unavailable, missing, or
optional, and the processing of the transaction is not dependent upon the presence of that
particular data. In those instances, multiple and adjacent separator characters shall appear together
rather than requiring the insertion of dummy data between separator characters.

For the definition of a field that consists of three information items, the following applies. If the
information for the second information item is missing, then two adjacent ‘US’ information
separator characters would occur between the first and third information items. If the second and
third information items were both missing, then three separator characters should be used — two
‘US’ characters in addition to the terminating field or subfield separator character. In general, if one
or more mandatory or optional information items are unavailable for a field or subfield, then the
appropriate number of separator character should be inserted.

It is possible to have side-by-side combinations of two or more of the four available separator
characters. When data are missing or unavailable for information items, subfields, or fields, there
shall be one separator character less than the number of data items, subfields, or fields required.

2.2. Record layout

For tagged-field logical records, each information field that is used shall be numbered in accordance
with this standard. The format for each field shall consist of the logical record type number followed
by a period ‘.’, a field number followed by a colon ‘:’, followed by the information appropriate to that
field. The tagged-field number can be any one-to-nine digit number occurring between the period ‘.’
and the colon ‘:’. It shall be interpreted as an unsigned integer field number. This implies that a field
number of ‘2.123:’ is equivalent to and shall be interpreted in the same manner as a field number of
‘2.000000123:’.

For purposes of illustration throughout this document, a three-digit number shall be used for
enumerating the fields contained in each of the tagged-field logical records described herein. Field
numbers will have the form of ‘TT.xxx:’ where the ‘TT’ represents the one- or two-character record
type followed by a period. The next three characters comprise the appropriate field number
followed by a colon. Descriptive ASCII information or the image data follows the colon.

Logical Type-1 and Type-2 records contain only ASCII textual data fields. The entire length of the
record (including field numbers, colons, and separator characters) shall be recorded as the first ASCII
field within each of these record types. The ASCII File Separator ‘FS’ control character (signifying the
end of the logical record or transaction) shall follow the last byte of ASCII information and shall be
included in the length of the record.

In contrast to the tagged-field concept, the Type-4 record contains only binary data recorded as
ordered fixed-length binary fields. The entire length of the record shall be recorded in the first four-
byte binary field of each record. For this binary record, neither the record number with its period,
nor the field identifier number and its following colon, shall be recorded. Furthermore, as all the
field lengths of this record is either fixed or specified, none of the four separator characters (‘US’,
‘RS’, ‘GS’, or ‘FS’) shall be interpreted as anything other than binary data. For the binary record, the
‘FS’ character shall not be used as a record separator or transaction terminating character.

3. Type-1 Logical Record: the File Header

This record describes the structure of the file, the type of the file, and other important information.
The character set used for Type-1 fields shall contain only the 7-bit ANSI code for information
interchange.

3.1. Fields for Type-1 Logical Record

3.1.1. _Field 1.001: Logical Record Length (LEN)_

This field contains the total count of the number of bytes in the whole Type-1 logical record. The
field begins with ‘1.001:’, followed by the total length of the record including every character of
every field and the information separators.


_This document has been agreed between the European Union and the United Kingdom and is provided for information only.
No rights may be derived from it until the date of application. The numbering of the articles is provisional._

3.1.2. _Field 1.002: Version Number (VER)_

To ensure that users know which version of the ANSI/NIST standard is being used, this four byte field
specifies the version number of the standard being implemented by the software or system creating
the file. The first two bytes specify the major version reference number, the second two the minor
revision number. For example, the original 1986 Standard would be considered the first version and
designated ‘0100’ while the present ANSI/NIST-ITL 1-2000 standard is ‘0300’.

3.1.3. _Field 1.003: File Content (CNT)_

This field lists each of the records in the file by record type and the order in which the records
appear in the logical file. It consists of one or more subfields, each of which in turn contains two
information items describing a single logical record found in the current file. The subfields are
entered in the same order in which the records are recorded and transmitted.

The first information item in the first subfield is ‘1’, to refer to this Type-1 record. It is followed by a
second information item which contains the number of other records contained in the file. This
number is also equal to the count of the remaining subfields of field 1.003.

Each of the remaining subfields is associated with one record within the file, and the sequence of
subfields corresponds to the sequence of records. Each subfield contains two items of information.
The first is to identify the Type of the record. The second is the record's IDC. The ‘US’ character shall
be used to separate the two information items.

3.1.4. _Field 1.004: Type of Transaction (TOT)_

This field contains a three letter mnemonic designating the type of the transaction. These codes may
be different from those used by other implementations of the ANSI/NIST standard.

CPS: Criminal Print-to-Print Search. This transaction is a request for a search of a record relating to a
criminal offence against a prints database. The person's prints shall be included as WSQ-compressed
images in the file.

In case of a No-HIT, the following logical records will be returned:

- 1 Type-1 Record,
- 1 Type-2 Record.

In case of a HIT, the following logical records will be returned:

PMS: Print-to-Latent Search. This transaction is used when a set of prints is searched against an
Unidentified Latent database. The response will contain the HIT/No-HIT decision of the destination
AFIS search. If multiple unidentified latents exist, multiple SRE transactions will be returned, with
one latent per transaction. The person's prints shall be included as WSQ-compressed images in the
file.

In case of a No-HIT, the following logical records will be returned:

- 1 Type-13 Record.

The PMS TOT is summarised in Table A.6.1 (Appendix 6).

MPS: Latent-to-Print Search. This transaction is used when a latent is to be searched against a Prints
database. The latent minutiæ information and the image (WSQ-compressed) shall be included in the
file.

In case of a No-HIT, the following logical records will be returned:

- 1 Type-1 Record,
- 1 Type-2 Record.

In case of a HIT, the following logical records will be returned:

- 1 Type-1 Record,

- 1 Type-4 or Type-15 Record.

The MPS TOT is summarised in Table A.6.4 (Appendix 6).

MMS: Latent-to-Latent Search. In this transaction the file contains a latent which is to be searched
against an Unidentified Latent database in order to establish links between various scenes of crime.
The latent minutiæ information and the image (WSQ-compressed) must be included in the file.

In case of a No-HIT, the following logical records will be returned:

- 1 Type-1 Record,


_This document has been agreed between the European Union and the United Kingdom and is provided for information only.
No rights may be derived from it until the date of application. The numbering of the articles is provisional._

- 1 Type-2 Record.

In case of a HIT, the following logical records will be returned:

- 1 Type-1 Record,
- 1 Type-2 Record,
- 1 Type-13 Record.

The MMS TOT is summarised in Table A.6.4 (Appendix 6).

SRE: This transaction is returned by the destination agency in response to dactyloscopic submissions.
The response will contain the HIT/No-HIT decision of the destination AFIS search. If multiple
candidates exist, multiple SRE transactions will be returned, with one candidate per transaction.

The SRE TOT is summarised in Table A.6.2 (Appendix 6).

ERR: This transaction is returned by the destination AFIS to indicate a transaction error. It includes a
message field (ERM) indicating the error detected. The following logical records will be returned:

C = Conditional on whether data is available,
 
 
— = Not allowed,
 
 
1* = Conditional depending on legacy systems.
 
3.1.5. _Field 1.005: Date of Transaction (DAT)_

This field indicates the date on which the transaction was initiated and shall conform to the ISO
standard notation of: YYYYMMDD

where YYYY is the year, MM is the month and DD is the day of the month. Leading zeros are used for
single figure numbers. For example, ‘19931004’ represents 4 October 1993.

3.1.6. _Field 1.006: Priority (PRY)_

This optional field defines the priority, on a level of 1 to 9, of the request. ‘1’ is the highest priority
and ‘9’ the lowest. Priority ‘1’ transactions shall be processed immediately.

3.1.7. _Field 1.007: Destination Agency Identifier (DAI)_

This field specifies the destination agency for the transaction.

It consists of two information items in the following format: CC/agency.

The first information item contains the Country Code, defined in ISO 3166, two alpha-numeric
characters long. The second item, _agency_ , is a free text identification of the agency, up to a
maximum of 32 alpha-numeric characters.

3.1.8. _Field 1.008: Originating Agency Identifier (ORI)_

This field specifies the file originator and has the same format as the DAI (Field 1.007).

3.1.9. _Field 1.009: Transaction Control Number (TCN)_

This is a control number for reference purposes. It should be generated by the computer and have
the following format: YYSSSSSSSSA

where YY is the year of the transaction, SSSSSSSS is an eight-digit serial number, and A is a check
character generated by following the procedure given in Appendix 2.


_This document has been agreed between the European Union and the United Kingdom and is provided for information only.
No rights may be derived from it until the date of application. The numbering of the articles is provisional._

Where a TCN is not available, the field, YYSSSSSSSS, is filled with zeros and the check character
generated as above.

3.1.10. _Field 1.010: Transaction Control Response (TCR)_

Where a request was sent out, to which this is the response, this optional field will contain the
transaction control number of the request message. It therefore has the same format as TCN (Field
1.009).

3.1.11. _Field 1.011: Native Scanning Resolution (NSR)_

This field specifies the normal scanning resolution of the system supported by the originator of the
transaction. The resolution is specified as two numeric digits followed by the decimal point and then
two more digits.

For all transactions pursuant to Articles LAW.PRUM.11 [Dactyloscopic data] and LAW.PRUM.12
[Automated searching of dactyloscopic data] the sampling rate shall be 500 pixels/inch or
19,68 pixels/mm.

3.1.12. _Field 1.012: Nominal Transmitting Resolution (NTR)_

This five-byte field specifies the nominal transmitting resolution for the images being transmitted.
The resolution is expressed in pixels/mm in the same format as NSR (Field 1.011).

3.1.13. _Field 1.013: Domain name (DOM)_

This mandatory field identifies the domain name for the user-defined Type-2 logical record
implementation. It consists of two information items and shall be ‘INT-I{}{US}}4.22{}{GS}}’.

3.1.14. _Field 1.014: Greenwich mean time (GMT)_

This mandatory field provides a mechanism for expressing the date and time in terms of universal
Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) units. If used, the GMT field contains the universal date that will be in
addition to the local date contained in Field 1.005 (DAT). Use of the GMT field eliminates local time
inconsistencies encountered when a transaction and its response are transmitted between two
places separated by several time zones. The GMT provides a universal date and 24-hour clock time
independent of time zones. It is represented as ‘CCYYMMDDHHMMSSZ’, a 15-character string that is
the concatenation of the date with the GMT and concludes with a ‘Z’. The ‘CCYY’ characters shall
represent the year of the transaction, the ‘MM’ characters shall be the tens and units values of the
month, and the ‘DD’ characters shall be the tens and units values of the day of the month, the ‘HH’
characters represent the hour, the ‘MM’ the minute, and the ‘SS’ represents the second. The
complete date shall not exceed the current date.

4. Type-2 Logical Record: Descriptive Text

The structure of most of this record is not defined by the original ANSI/NIST standard. The record
contains information of specific interest to the agencies sending or receiving the file. To ensure that
communicating dactyloscopic systems are compatible, it is required that only the fields listed below
are contained within the record. This document specifies which fields are mandatory and which
optional, and also defines the structure of the individual fields.


_This document has been agreed between the European Union and the United Kingdom and is provided for information only.
No rights may be derived from it until the date of application. The numbering of the articles is provisional._

4.1. Fields for Type-2 Logical Record

4.1.1. _Field 2.001: Logical Record Length (LEN)_

This mandatory field contains the length of this Type-2 record, and specifies the total number of
bytes including every character of every field contained in the record and the information
separators.

4.1.2. _Field 2.002: Image Designation Character (IDC)_

The IDC contained in this mandatory field is an ASCII representation of the IDC as defined in the File
Content field (CNT) of the Type-1 record (Field 1.003).

4.1.3. _Field 2.003: System Information (SYS)_

This field is mandatory and contains four bytes which indicate which version of the INT-I this
particular Type-2 record complies with.

The first two bytes specify the major version number, the second two the minor revision number.
For example, this implementation is based on INT-I version 4 revision 22 and would be represented
as ‘0422’.

4.1.4. _Field 2.007: Case Number (CNO)_

This is a number assigned by the local dactyloscopic bureau to a collection of latents found at a
scene-of-crime. The following format is adopted: CC/number

where CC is the Interpol Country Code, two alpha-numeric characters in length, and the number
complies with the appropriate local guidelines and may be up to 32 alpha-numeric characters long.

This field allows the system to identify latents associated with a particular crime.

4.1.5. _Field 2.008: Sequence Number (SQN)_

This specifies each sequence of latents within a case. It can be up to four numeric characters long. A
sequence is a latent or series of latents which are grouped together for the purposes of filing and/or
searching. This definition implies that even single latents will still have to be assigned a sequence
number.

This field together with MID (Field 2.009) may be included to identify a particular latent within a
sequence.

4.1.6. _Field 2.009: Latent Identifier (MID)_

This specifies the individual latent within a sequence. The value is a single letter or two letters, with
‘A’ assigned to the first latent, ‘B’ to the second, and so on up to a limit of ‘ZZ’. This field is used
analogue to the latent sequence number discussed in the description for SQN (Field 2.008).

4.1.7. _Field 2.010: Criminal Reference Number (CRN)_


_This document has been agreed between the European Union and the United Kingdom and is provided for information only.
No rights may be derived from it until the date of application. The numbering of the articles is provisional._

This is a unique reference number assigned by a national agency to an individual who is charged for
the first time with committing an offence. Within one country no individual ever has more than one
CRN, or shares it with any other individual. However, the same individual may have Criminal
Reference Numbers in several countries, which will be distinguishable by means of the country code.

The following format is adopted for CRN field: CC/number

where CC is the Country Code, defined in ISO 3166, two alpha-numeric characters in length, and the
number complies with the appropriate national guidelines of the issuing agency, and may be up to
32 alpha-numeric characters long.

For transactions pursuant to Articles LAW.PRUM.11 [Dactyloscopic data ]and LAW.PRUM.12
[Automated searching of dactyloscopic data] this field will be used for the national criminal
reference number of the originating agency which is linked to the images in Type-4 or Type- 15
Records.

4.1.8. _Field 2.012: Miscellaneous Identification Number (MN1)_

This fields contains the CRN (Field 2.010) transmitted by a CPS or PMS transaction without the
leading country code.

4.1.9. _Field 2.013: Miscellaneous Identification Number (MN2)_

This fields contains the CNO (Field 2.007) transmitted by an MPS or MMS transaction without the
leading country code.

4.1.10. _Field 2.014: Miscellaneous Identification Number (MN3)_

This fields contains the SQN (Field 2.008) transmitted by an MPS or MMS transaction.

4.1.11. _Field 2.015: Miscellaneous Identification Number (MN4)_

This fields contains the MID (Field 2.009) transmitted by an MPS or MMS transaction.

4.1.12. _Field 2.063: Additional Information (INF)_

In case of an SRE transaction to a PMS request this field gives information about the finger which
caused the possible HIT. The format of the field is:

_NN_ where _NN_ is the finger position code defined in Table 5, two digits in length.

In all other cases the field is optional. It consists of up to 32 alpha-numeric characters and may give
additional information about the request.

4.1.13. _Field 2.064: Respondents List (RLS)_

This field contains at least two subfields. The first subfield describes the type of search that has been
carried out, using the three-letter mnemonics which specify the transaction type in TOT (Field
1.004). The second subfield contains a single character. An ‘I’ shall be used to indicate that a HIT has
been found and an ‘N’ shall be used to indicate that no matching cases have been found (No-HIT).


_This document has been agreed between the European Union and the United Kingdom and is provided for information only.
No rights may be derived from it until the date of application. The numbering of the articles is provisional._

The third subfield contains the sequence identifier for the candidate result and the total number of
candidates separated by a slash. Multiple messages will be returned if multiple candidates exist.

In case of a possible HIT the fourth subfield shall contain the score up to six digits long. If the HIT has
been verified the value of this subfield is defined as ‘999999’.

Example: ‘CPS{}{RS}}I{}{RS}}001/001{}{RS}}999999{}{GS}}’

If the remote AFIS does not assign scores, then a score of zero should be used at the appropriate
point.

4.1.14. _Field 2.074: Status/Error Message Field (ERM)_

This field contains error messages resulting from transactions, which will be sent back to the
requester as part of an Error Transaction.

5. Type-4 Logical Record: High Resolution GreyScale Image

It should be noted that Type-4 records are binary rather than ASCII in nature. Therefore each field is
assigned a specific position within the record, which implies that all fields are mandatory.

The standard allows both image size and resolution to be specified within the record. It requires
Type-4 Logical Records to contain dactyloscopic image data that are being transmitted at a nominal
pixel density of 500 to 520 pixels per inch. The preferred rate for new designs is at a pixel density of
500 pixels per inch or 19,68 pixels per mm. 500 pixels per inch is the density specified by the INT-I,
except that similar systems may communicate with each other at a non-preferred rate, within the
limits of 500 to 520 pixels per inch.

5.1. Fields for Type-4 Logical Record

5.1.1. _Field 4.001: Logical Record Length (LEN)_

This four-byte field contains the length of this Type-4 record, and specifies the total number of bytes
including every byte of every field contained in the record.

5.1.2. _Field 4.002: Image Designation Character (IDC)_

This is the one-byte binary representation of the IDC number given in the header file.

5.1.3. _Field 4.003: Impression Type (IMP)_

The impression type is a single-byte field occupying the sixth byte of the record.

5.1.4. _Field 4.004: Finger Position (FGP)_

This fixed-length field of six bytes occupies the seventh through twelfth byte positions of a Type- 4
record. It contains possible finger positions beginning in the left most byte (byte seven of the
record). The known or most probable finger position is taken from Table 5. Up to five additional
fingers may be referenced by entering the alternate finger positions in the remaining five bytes using
the same format. If fewer than five finger position references are to be used the unused bytes are
filled with binary 255. To reference all finger positions code 0, for unknown, is used.

5.1.5. _Field 4.005: Image Scanning Resolution (ISR)_

This one-byte field occupies the 13th byte of a Type-4 record. If it contains ' 0 ' then the image has
been sampled at the preferred scanning rate of 19,68 pixels/mm (500 pixels per inch). If it contains
' 1 ' then the image has been sampled at an alternative scanning rate as specified in the Type- 1
record.

5.1.6. _Field 4.006: Horizontal Line Length (HLL)_

This field is positioned at bytes 14 and 15 within the Type-4 record. It specifies the number of pixels
contained in each scan line. The first byte will be the most significant.

5.1.7. _Field 4.007: Vertical Line Length (VLL)_

This field records in bytes 16 and 17 the number of scan lines present in the image. The first byte is
the most significant.

5.1.8. _Field 4.008: Greyscale Compression Algorithm (GCA)_

This one-byte field specifies the greyscale compression algorithm used to encode the image data.
For this implementation, a binary code 1 indicates that WSQ compression (Appendix 7) has been
used.

5.1.9. _Field 4.009: The Image_

This field contains a byte stream representing the image. Its structure will obviously depend on the
compression algorithm used.

6. Type-9 Logical Record: Minutiæ Record

Type-9 records shall contain ASCII text describing minutiæ and related information encoded from a
latent. For latent search transaction, there is no limit for these Type-9 records in a file, each of which
shall be for a different view or latent.

6.1. Minutiæ extraction

6.1.1. _Minutia type identification_

This standard defines three identifier numbers that are used to describe the minutia type. These are
listed in Table 6. A ridge ending shall be designated Type 1. A bifurcation shall be designated Type 2.
If a minutia cannot be clearly categorised as one of the above two types, it shall be designated as
‘other’, Type 0.

 
Table 6: Minutia types
 

_This document has been agreed between the European Union and the United Kingdom and is provided for information only.
No rights may be derived from it until the date of application. The numbering of the articles is provisional._

 
Type Description
 
 
0 Other
 
 
1 Ridge ending
 
 
2 Bifurcation
 
6.1.2. _Minutia placement and type_

For templates to be compliant with Section 5 of the ANSI INCITS 378-2004 standard, the following
method, which enhances the current INCITS 378-2004 standard, shall be used for determining
placement (location and angular direction) of individual minutiæ.

The position or location of a minutia representing a ridge ending shall be the point of forking of the
medial skeleton of the valley area immediately in front of the ridge ending. If the three legs of the
valley area were thinned down to a single-pixel-wide skeleton, the point of the intersection is the
location of the minutia. Similarly, the location of the minutia for a bifurcation shall be the point of
forking of the medial skeleton of the ridge. If the three legs of the ridge were each thinned down to
a single-pixel-wide skeleton, the point where the three legs intersect is the location of the minutia.

After all ridge endings have been converted to bifurcations, all of the minutiæ of the dactyloscopic
image are represented as bifurcations. The X and Y pixel coordinates of the intersection of the three
legs of each minutia can be directly formatted. Determination of the minutia direction can be
extracted from each skeleton bifurcation. The three legs of every skeleton bifurcation shall be
examined and the endpoint of each leg determined. Figure 6.1.2 illustrates the three methods used
for determining the end of a leg that is based on a scanning resolution of 500 ppi.

The ending is established according to the event that occurs first. The pixel count is based on a scan
resolution of 500 ppi. Different scan resolutions would imply different pixel counts.

- a distance of 0,064" (the 32nd pixel);
- the end of skeleton leg that occurs between a distance of 0,02" and 0,064" (the 10th

 
through the 32nd pixels); shorter legs are not used;
 
- a second bifurcation is encountered within a distance of 0,064" (before the 32nd pixel).

The angle of the minutiæ is determined by constructing three virtual rays originating at the
bifurcation point and extending to the end of each leg. The smallest of the three angles formed by
the rays is bisected to indicate the minutiæ direction.

6.1.3. _Coordinate system_

The coordinate system used to express the minutiæ of a fingerprint shall be a Cartesian coordinate
system. Minutiæ locations shall be represented by their x and y coordinates. The origin of the
coordinate system shall be the upper left corner of the original image with x increasing to the right
and y increasing downward. Both x and y coordinates of a minutiæ shall be represented in pixel units
from the origin. It should be noted that the location of the origin and units of measure is not in
agreement with the convention used in the definitions of the Type 9 in the ANSI/NIST-ITL 1-2000.

6.1.4. _Minutiæ direction_

Angles are expressed in standard mathematical format, with zero degrees to the right and angles
increasing in the counter clockwise direction. Recorded angles are in the direction pointing back
along the ridge for a ridge ending and toward the centre of the valley for a bifurcation. This
convention is 180 degrees opposite of the angle convention described in the definitions of the Type
9 in the ANSI/NIST-ITL 1-2000.

6.2. Fields for Type-9 Logical record INCITS-378 Format

Industry Association (IBIA) to INCITS Technical Committee M1. The <US> character shall delimit this
item from the CBEFF Format Type that is assigned a value of ‘513’ (0x0201) to indicate that this
record contains only location and angular direction data without any Extended Data Block
information. The <US> character shall delimit this item from the CBEFF Product Identifier (PID) that
identifies the ‘owner’ of the encoding equipment. The vendor establishes this value. It can be
obtained from the IBIA website (www.ibia.org) if it is posted.

6.2.6. _Field 9.127: Capture equipment identification_

This field shall contain two information items separated by the <US> character. The first shall contain
‘APPF’ if the equipment used originally to acquire the image was certified to comply with Appendix F
(IAFIS Image Quality Specification, 29 January 1999) of CJIS-RS-0010, the Federal Bureau of
Investigation's Electronic Fingerprint Transmission Specification. If the equipment did not comply, it
will contain the value of ‘NONE’. The second information item shall contain the Capture Equipment
ID which is a vendor-assigned product number of the capture equipment. A value of ‘0’ indicates
that the capture equipment ID is unreported.

6.2.9. _Field 9.130: Scale units (SLC)_

This mandatory ASCII field shall specify the units used to describe the image sampling frequency
(pixel density). A ‘1’ in this field indicates pixels per inch, or a ‘2’ indicates pixels per centimetre. A ‘0’
in this field indicates no scale is given. In this case, the quotient of HPS/VPS gives the pixel aspect
ratio.

6.2.10. _Field 9.131: Horizontal pixel scale (HPS)_


_This document has been agreed between the European Union and the United Kingdom and is provided for information only.
No rights may be derived from it until the date of application. The numbering of the articles is provisional._

This mandatory ASCII field shall specify the integer pixel density used in the horizontal direction
providing the SLC contains a ‘1’ or a ‘2’. Otherwise, it indicates the horizontal component of the pixel
aspect ratio.

6.2.11. _Field 9.132: Vertical pixel scale (VPS)_

This mandatory ASCII field shall specify the integer pixel density used in the vertical direction
providing the SLC contains a ‘1’ or a ‘2’. Otherwise, it indicates the vertical component of the pixel
aspect ratio.

6.2.12. _Field 9.133: Finger view_

This mandatory field contains the view number of the finger associated with this record's data. The
view number begins with ‘0’ and increments by one to ‘15’.

6.2.13. _Field 9.134: Finger position (FGP)_

This field shall contain the code designating the finger position that produced the information in this
Type-9 record. A code between 1 and 10 taken from Table 5 or the appropriate palm code from
Table 10 shall be used to indicate the finger or palm position.

6.2.14. _Field 9.135: Finger quality_

The field shall contain the quality of the overall finger minutiæ data and shall be between 0 and 100.
This number is an overall expression of the quality of the finger record, and represents quality of the
original image, of the minutia extraction and any additional operations that may affect the minutiæ
record.

6 .2.15. _Field 9.136: number of minutiæ_

The mandatory field shall contain a count of the number of minutiæ recorded in this logical record.

6.2.16. _Field 9.137: Finger minutiæ data_

This mandatory field has six information items separated by the <US> character. It consists of several
subfields, each containing the details of single minutiae. The total number of minutiae subfields
must agree with the count found in field 136. The first information item is the minutiae index
number, which shall be initialised to ‘1’ and incremented by ‘1’ for each additional minutia in the
fingerprint. The second and third information items are the ‘x’ coordinate and ‘y’ coordinates of the
minutiae in pixel units. The fourth information item is the minutiae angle recorded in units of two
degrees. This value shall be nonnegative between 0 and 179. The fifth information item is the
minutiae type. A value of ‘0’ is used to represent minutiae of type ‘OTHER’, a value of ‘1’ for a ridge
ending and a value of ‘2’ for a ridge bifurcation. The sixth information item represents the quality of
each minutiae. This value shall range from 1 as a minimum to 100 as a maximum. A value of ‘0’
indicates that no quality value is available. Each subfield shall be separated from the next with the
use of the <RS> separator character.

6.2.17. _Field 9.138: Ridge count information_


_This document has been agreed between the European Union and the United Kingdom and is provided for information only.
No rights may be derived from it until the date of application. The numbering of the articles is provisional._

This field consists of a series of subfields each containing three information items. The first
information item of the first subfield shall indicate the ridge count extraction method. A ‘0’ indicates
that no assumption shall be made about the method used to extract ridge counts, nor their order in
the record. A ‘1’ indicates that for each centre minutiæ, ridge count data was extracted to the
nearest neighbouring minutiæ in four quadrants, and ridge counts for each centre minutia are listed
together. A ‘2’ indicates that for each centre minutiæ, ridge count data was extracted to the nearest
neighbouring minutiæ in eight octants, and ridge counts for each centre minutia are listed together.
The remaining two information items of the first subfield shall both contain ‘0’. Information items
shall be separated by the <US> separator character. Subsequent subfields will contain the centre
minutiæ index number as the first information item, the neighbouring minutiæ index number as the
second information item, and the number of ridges crossed as the third information item. Subfields
shall be separated by the <RS> separator character.

7.1. Fields for the Type-13 logical record

The following paragraphs describe the data contained in each of the fields for the Type-13 logical
record.

Within a Type-13 logical record, entries shall be provided in numbered fields. It is required that the
first two fields of the record are ordered, and the field containing the image data shall be the last
physical field in the record. For each field of the Type-13 record, Table 7 lists the ‘condition code’ as
being mandatory ‘M’ or optional ‘O’, the field number, the field name, character type, field size, and
occurrence limits. Based on a three digit field number, the maximum byte count size for the field is
given in the last column. As more digits are used for the field number, the maximum byte count will
also increase. The two entries in the ‘field size per occurrence’ include all character separators used
in the field. The ‘maximum byte count’ includes the field number, the information, and all the
character separators including the ‘GS’ character.

7.1.1. _Field 13.001: Logical record length (LEN)_

This mandatory ASCII field shall contain the total count of the number of bytes in the Type-13 logical
record. Field 13.001 shall specify the length of the record including every character of every field
contained in the record and the information separators.

7.1.2. _Field 13.002: Image designation character (IDC)_

two information items in the following format: CC/agency.

The first information item contains the Interpol Country Code, two alpha-numeric characters long.
The second item, agency, is a free text identification of the agency, up to a maximum of 32 alpha-
numeric characters.

7.1.5. _Field 13.005: Latent capture date (LCD)_

This mandatory ASCII field shall contain the date that the latent image contained in the record was

in this field indicates no scale is given. In this case, the quotient of HPS/VPS gives the pixel aspect
ratio.

7.1.9. _Field 13.009: Horizontal pixel scale (HPS)_

This mandatory ASCII field shall specify the integer pixel density used in the horizontal direction
providing the SLC contains a ‘1’ or a ‘2’. Otherwise, it indicates the horizontal component of the pixel
aspect ratio.

7.1.10. _Field 13.010: Vertical pixel scale (VPS)_

This mandatory ASCII field shall specify the integer pixel density used in the vertical direction
providing the SLC contains a ‘1’ or a ‘2’. Otherwise, it indicates the vertical component of the pixel
aspect ratio.

7.1.11. _Field 13.011: Compression algorithm (CGA)_

This mandatory ASCII field shall specify the algorithm used to compress greyscale images. See
Appendix 7 for the compression codes.

7.1.12. _Field 13.012: Bits per pixel (BPX)_

This mandatory ASCII field shall contain the number of bits used to represent a pixel. This field shall
contain an entry of ‘8’ for normal greyscale values of ‘0’ to ‘255’. Any entry in this field greater than

may match the latent image. The decimal code number corresponding to the known or most
probable finger position shall be taken from Table 5 or the most probable palm position from Table
10 and entered as a one- or two-character ASCII subfield. Additional finger and/or palm positions
may be referenced by entering the alternate position codes as subfields separated by the ‘RS’
separator character. The code ‘0’, for ‘Unknown Finger’, shall be used to reference every finger
position from one through ten. The code ‘20’, for ‘Unknown Palm’, shall be used to reference every
listed palmprint position.

7.1.14. _Field 13.014-019: Reserved for future definition (RSV)_

These fields are reserved for inclusion in future revisions of this standard. None of these fields are to
be used at this revision level. If any of these fields are present, they are to be ignored.

7.1.15. _Field 13.020: Comment (COM)_

This optional field may be used to insert comments or other ASCII text information with the latent
image data.

7.1.16. _Field 13.0 21 - 199: Reserved for future definition (RSV)_

These fields are reserved for inclusion in future revisions of this standard. None of these fields are to
be used at this revision level. If any of these fields are present, they are to be ignored.

7.1.17. _Fields 13.200-998: User-defined fields (UDF)_

These fields are user-definable fields and will be used for future requirements. Their size and
content shall be defined by the user and be in accordance with the receiving agency. If present they
shall contain ASCII textual information.

7.1.18. _Field 13.999: Image data (DAT)_

This field shall contain all data from a captured latent image. It shall always be assigned field number
999 and shall be the last physical field in the record. For example, ‘13.999:’ is followed by image data
in a binary representation.

Each pixel of uncompressed greyscale data shall normally be quantised to eight bits (256 grey levels)
contained in a single byte. If the entry in BPX Field 13.012 is greater or less than ‘8’, the number of
bytes required to contain a pixel will be different. If compression is used, the pixel data shall be
compressed in accordance with the compression technique specified in the GCA field.

7.2. End of Type-13 variable-resolution latent image record

For the sake of consistency, immediately following the last byte of data from Field 13.999 an ‘FS’
separator shall be used to separate it from the next logical record. This separator shall be included in
the length field of the Type-13 record.

8. Type-15 variable-resolution palmprint image record

The Type-15 tagged-field logical record shall contain and be used to exchange palmprint image data
together with fixed and user-defined textual information fields pertinent to the digitised image.
Information regarding the scanning resolution used, the image size and other parameters or
comments required to process the image are recorded as tagged-fields within the record. Palmprint
images transmitted to other agencies will be processed by the recipient agencies to extract the
desired feature information required for matching purposes.

The image data shall be acquired directly from a subject using a live-scan device, or from a palmprint
card or other media that contains the subject's palmprints.


_This document has been agreed between the European Union and the United Kingdom and is provided for information only.
No rights may be derived from it until the date of application. The numbering of the articles is provisional._

Any method used to acquire the palmprint images shall be capable of capturing a set of images for
each hand. This set shall include the writer's palm as a single scanned image, and the entire area of
the full palm extending from the wrist bracelet to the tips of the fingers as one or two scanned
images. If two images are used to represent the full palm, the lower image shall extend from the
wrist bracelet to the top of the interdigital area (third finger joint) and shall include the thenar, and
hypothenar areas of the palm. The upper image shall extend from the bottom of the interdigital area
to the upper tips of the fingers. This provides an adequate amount of overlap between the two
images that are both located over the interdigital area of the palm. By matching the ridge structure
and details contained in this common area, an examiner can confidently state that both images
came from the same palm.

As a palmprint transaction may be used for different purposes, it may contain one or more unique
image areas recorded from the palm or hand. A complete palmprint record set for one individual will
normally include the writer's palm and the full palm image(s) from each hand. Since a tagged-field
logical image record may contain only one binary field, a single Type-15 record will be required for
each writer's palm and one or two Type-15 records for each full palm. Therefore, four to six Type- 15
records will be required to represent the subject's palmprints in a normal palmprint transaction.

8.1. Fields for the Type-15 logical record

The following paragraphs describe the data contained in each of the fields for the Type-15 logical
record.

Within a Type-15 logical record, entries shall be provided in numbered fields. It is required that the
first two fields of the record are ordered, and the field containing the image data shall be the last
physical field in the record. For each field of the Type-15 record, Table 8 lists the ‘condition code’ as
being mandatory ‘M’ or optional ‘O’, the field number, the field name, character type, field size, and
occurrence limits. Based on a three digit field number, the maximum byte count size for the field is
given in the last column. As more digits are used for the field number, the maximum byte count will
also increase. The two entries in the ‘field size per occurrence’ include all character separators used
in the field. The ‘maximum byte count’ includes the field number, the information, and all the
character separators including the ‘GS’ character.

8.1.1. _Field 15.001: Logical record length (LEN)_

This mandatory ASCII field shall contain the total count of the number of bytes in the Type-15 logical
record. Field 15.001 shall specify the length of the record including every character of every field
contained in the record and the information separators.

8.1.2. _Field 15.002: Image designation character (IDC)_

This mandatory ASCII field shall be used to identify the palmprint image contained in the record. This
IDC shall match the IDC found in the file content (CNT) field of the Type-1 record.

8.1.3. _Field 15.003: Impression type (IMP)_

This mandatory one-byte ASCII field shall indicate the manner by which the palmprint image
information was obtained. The appropriate code selected from Table 9 shall be entered in this field.

8.1.4. _Field 15.004: Source agency/ORI (SRC)_


_This document has been agreed between the European Union and the United Kingdom and is provided for information only.
No rights may be derived from it until the date of application. The numbering of the articles is provisional._

This mandatory ASCII field shall contain the identification of the administration or organisation that
originally captured the facial image contained in the record. Normally, the Originating Agency
Identifier (ORI) of the agency that captured the image will be contained in this field. It consists of
two information items in the following format: CC/agency.

The first information item contains the Interpol Country Code, two alpha-numeric characters long.
The second item, agency, is a free text identification of the agency, up to a maximum of 32 alpha-
numeric characters.

8.1.5. _Field 15.005: Palmprint capture date (PCD)_

This mandatory ASCII field shall contain the date that the palmprint image was captured. The date
shall appear as eight digits in the format CCYYMMDD. The CCYY characters shall represent the year
the image was captured; the MM characters shall be the tens and unit values of the month; and the
DD characters shall be the tens and units values of the day in the month. For example, the entry
20000229 represents 29 February 2000. The complete date shall be a legitimate date.

8.1.6. _Field 15.006: Horizontal line length (HLL)_

This mandatory ASCII field shall contain the number of pixels contained on a single horizontal line of
the transmitted image.

8.1.7. _Field 15.007: Vertical line length (VLL)_

This mandatory ASCII field shall contain the number of horizontal lines contained in the transmitted
image.

8.1.8. _Field 15.008: Scale units (SLC)_

This mandatory ASCII field shall specify the units used to describe the image sampling frequency
(pixel density). A ‘1’ in this field indicates pixels per inch, or a ‘2’ indicates pixels per centimetre. A ‘0’
in this field indicates no scale is given. In this case, the quotient of HPS/VPS gives the pixel aspect
ratio.

8.1.9. _Field 15.009: Horizontal pixel scale (HPS)_

This mandatory ASCII field shall specify the integer pixel density used in the horizontal direction
providing the SLC contains a ‘1’ or a ‘2’. Other-wise, it indicates the horizontal component of the
pixel aspect ratio.

8.1.10. _Field 15.010: Vertical pixel scale (VPS)_

This mandatory ASCII field shall specify the integer pixel density used in the vertical direction
providing the SLC contains a ‘1’ or a ‘2’. Otherwise, it indicates the vertical component of the pixel
aspect ratio.

CHAPTER 3: Exchange of vehicle registration data
 
1. Common data-set for automated search of vehicle registration data

1.1. Definitions

The definitions of mandatory and optional data elements set out in Article 14(4) of Chapter 0 are as
follows:

Mandatory (M):

The data element has to be communicated when the information is available in a State's national
register. Therefore there is an obligation to exchange the information when available.

Optional (O):

The data element may be communicated when the information is available in a State's national
register. Therefore there is no obligation to exchange the information even when the information is
available.

An indication (Y) is given for each element in the data set where the element is specifically identified
as important in relation with Article LAW.PRUM.15 [Automated searching of vehicle registration
data].

1.2. Vehicle/owner/holder search

1.2.1. _Triggers for the search_


_This document has been agreed between the European Union and the United Kingdom and is provided for information only.
No rights may be derived from it until the date of application. The numbering of the articles is provisional._

There are two different ways to search for the information as defined in the next paragraph:

- by Chassis Number (VIN), Reference Date and Time (optional),
- by License Plate Number, Chassis Number (VIN) (optional), Reference Date and Time

 
(optional).
 
By means of these search criteria, information related to one and sometimes more vehicles will be
returned. If information for only one vehicle has to be returned, all the items are returned in one
response. If more than one vehicle is found, the requested State itself can determine which items
will be returned; all items or only the items to refine the search (e.g. because of privacy reasons or
because of performance reasons).

The items necessary to refine the search are pictured in paragraph 1.2.2.1. In paragraph 1.2.2.2 the
complete information set is described.

When the search is done by Chassis Number, Reference Date and Time, the search can be done in
one or all of the participating States.

When the search is done by License Number, Reference Data and Time, the search has to be done in
one specific State.

Normally the actual Date and Time is used to make a search, but it is possible to conduct a search
with a Reference Date and Time in the past. When a search is made with a Reference Date and Time
in the past and historical information is not available in the register of the specific State because no
such information is registered at all, the actual information can be returned with an indication that
the information is actual information.

2. Data Security

2.1. Overview

The Eucaris software application handles secure communication to the other States and
communicates to the back-end legacy systems of States using XML. States exchange messages by
directly sending them to the recipient. The data centre of a State is connected to the TESTA network.

(^154) In Luxembourg two separate vehicle registration document ID's are used.


_This document has been agreed between the European Union and the United Kingdom and is provided for information only.
No rights may be derived from it until the date of application. The numbering of the articles is provisional._

The XML-messages sent over the network are encrypted. The technique to encrypt these messages
is SSL. The messages sent to the back-end are plain text XML-messages since the connection
between the application and the back-end shall be in a protected environment.

A client application is provided which can be used within a State to query their own register or other
States' registers. The clients will be identified by means of user-id/password or a client certificate.
The connection to a user may be encrypted, but this is the responsibility of each individual State.

2.2. Security Features related to message exchange

The security design is based on a combination of HTTPS and XML signature. This alternative uses
XML-signature to sign all messages sent so the server and can authenticate the sender of the
message by checking the signature. 1-sided SSL (only a server certificate) is used to protect the
confidentiality and integrity of the message in transit and provides protection against
deletion/replay and insertion attacks. Instead of bespoke software development to implement 2-
sided SSL, XML-signature is implemented. Using XML-signature is closer to the web services roadmap
than 2-sided SSL and therefore more strategic.

The XML-signature can be implemented in several ways but the chosen approach is to use XML
Signature as part of the Web Services Security (WSS). WSS specifies how to use XML-signature. Since
WSS builds upon the SOAP standard, it is logical to adhere to the SOAP standard as much as possible.

2.3. Security features not related to message exchange

2.3.1. _Authentication of users_

The users of the Eucaris web application authenticate themselves using a username and password.
Since standard Windows authentication is used, States can enhance the level of authentication of
users if needed by using client certificates.

2.3.2. _User roles_

The Eucaris software application supports different user roles. Each cluster of services has its own
authorisation. E.g. (exclusive) users of the ‘“Treaty of Eucaris” — functionality’ may not use the
‘“Prüm” — functionality’. Administrator services are separated from the regular end-user roles.

2.3.3. _Logging and tracing of message exchange_

Logging of all message types is facilitated by the Eucaris software application. An administrator
function allows the national administrator to determine which messages are logged: requests from
end-users, incoming requests from other States, provided information from the national registers,
etc.

The application can be configured to use an internal database for this logging, or an external (Oracle)
database. The decision on what messages have to be logged clearly depends on logging facilities
elsewhere in the legacy systems and connected client applications.

The header of each message contains information on the requesting State, the requesting
organisation within that State and the user involved. Also the reason of the request is indicated.


_This document has been agreed between the European Union and the United Kingdom and is provided for information only.
No rights may be derived from it until the date of application. The numbering of the articles is provisional._

By means of the combined logging in the requesting and responding State complete tracing of any
message exchange is possible (e.g. on request of a citizen involved).

Logging is configured through the Eucaris web client (menu Administration, Logging configuration).
The logging functionality is performed by the Core System. When logging is enabled, the complete
message (header and body) is stored in one logging record. Per defined service, and per message
type that passes along the Core System, the logging level can be set.

Logging Levels

The following logging levels are possible:

Private — Message is logged: The logging is NOT available to the extract logging service but is
available on a national level only, for audits and problem solving.

None — Message is not logged at all.

Message Types

Information exchange between States consists of several messages, of which a schematic
representation is given in Figure 5 below.

The possible message types (in Figure 5 shown for the Eucaris Core System of State X) are the
following:

1. Request to Core System_Request message by Client;
2. Request to Other State_Request message by Core System of this State;
3. Request to Core System of this State_Request message by Core System of other

 
State;
 
4. Request to Legacy Register_Request message by Core System;
5. Request to Core System_Request message by Legacy Register;
6. Response from Core System_Request message by Client;
7. Response from Other State_Request message by Core System of this State;
8. Response from Core System of this State_Request message by other State;
9. Response from Legacy Register_Request message by Core System;
10. Response from Core System_Request message by Legacy Register.

The following information exchanges are shown in Figure 5:

 
* Information request from State X to State Y — blue arrows. This request and response
consists of message types 1, 2, 7 and 6, respectively;
 

_This document has been agreed between the European Union and the United Kingdom and is provided for information only.
No rights may be derived from it until the date of application. The numbering of the articles is provisional._

 
* Information request from State Z to State X — red arrows. This request and response
consists of message types 3, 4, 9 and 8, respectively;
 
 
* Information request from the legacy register to its core system (this route also
includes a request from a custom client behind the legacy register) — green arrows.
This kind of request consists of message types 5 and 10.

2.3.4. _Hardware Security Module_

A Hardware Security Module is not used.

A Hardware Security Module (HSM) provides good protection for the key used to sign messages and
to identify servers. This adds to the overall level of security but an HSM is expensive to buy/maintain
and there are no requirements to decide for a FIPS 140-2 level 2 or level 3 HSM. Since a closed
network is used that mitigates threats effectively, it is decided not to use an HSM initially. If an HSM
is necessary e.g. to obtain accreditation, it can be added to the architecture.

3. Technical conditions of the data exchange

3.1. General description of the Eucaris application

3.1.1. _Overview_

The Eucaris application connects all participating States in a mesh network where each State
communicates directly to another State. There is no central component needed for the
communication to be established. The Eucaris application handles secure communication to the
other States and communicates to the back-end legacy systems of States using XML. The following
picture visualises this architecture.


_This document has been agreed between the European Union and the United Kingdom and is provided for information only.
No rights may be derived from it until the date of application. The numbering of the articles is provisional._

States exchange messages by directly sending them to the recipient. The data centre of a State is
connected to the network used for the message exchange (TESTA). To access the TESTA network,
States connect to TESTA via their national gate. A firewall shall be used to connect to the network
and a router connects the Eucaris application to the firewall. Depending on the alternative chosen to
protect the messages, a certificate is used either by the router or by the Eucaris application.

A client application is provided which can be used within a State to query its own register or other
States' registers. The client application connects to Eucaris. The clients will be identified by means of
user-id/password or a client certificate. The connection to a user in an external organisation (e.g.
police) may be encrypted but this is the responsibility of each individual State.

3.1.2. _Scope of the system_

The scope of the Eucaris system is limited to the processes involved in the exchange of information
between the Registration Authorities in the States and a basic presentation of this information.
Procedures and automated processes in which the information is to be used, are outside the scope
of the system.

States can choose either to use the Eucaris client functionality or to set up their own customised
client application. The table below describes which aspects of the Eucaris system are mandatory to
use and/or prescribed and which are optional to use and/or free to determine by the States.

network

Core

application

 
M The core application of Eucaris has to be used to connect to the other
States. The following functionality is offered by the core:
 
 
* Encrypting and signing of the messages;
 
 
* Checking of the identity of the sender;
 
 
* Authorisation of States and local users;
 
 
* Routing of messages;
 
 
* Queuing of asynchronous messages if the recipient service is
temporally unavailable;
 
 
* Multiple country inquiry functionality;
 
 
* Logging of the exchange of messages;
 
 
* Storage of incoming messages
 
Client

application

 
O In addition to the core application the Eucaris II client application can be
used by a State. When applicable, the core and client application are
modified under auspices of the Eucaris organisation.
 
Security

concept

 
M The concept is based on XML-signing by means of client certificates and
SSL-encryption by means of service certificates.
 
Message

specifications

 
M Every State has to comply with the message specifications as set by the
Eucaris organisation and this Chapter. The specifications can only be
changed by the Eucaris organisation in consultation with the States.
 
Operation

and Support

 
M The acceptance of new States or a new functionality is under auspices of
the Eucaris organisation. Monitoring and help desk functions are managed
centrally by an appointed State.
 
3.2. Functional and Non-Functional Requirements

3.2.1. _Generic functionality_

In this section the main generic functions have been described in general terms.

No Description


_This document has been agreed between the European Union and the United Kingdom and is provided for information only.
No rights may be derived from it until the date of application. The numbering of the articles is provisional._

1. The system allows the Registration Authorities of the States to exchange request and

 
response messages in an interactive way.
 
2. The system contains a client application, enabling end-users to send their requests and

 
presenting the response information for manual processing.
 
3. The system facilitates ‘broadcasting’, allowing a State to send a request to all other States.

 
The incoming responses are consolidated by the core application in one response message
to the client application (this functionality is called a "Multiple Country Inquiry”).
 
4. The system is able to deal with different types of messages. User roles, authorisation,

 
routing, signing and logging are all defined per specific service.
 
5. The system allows the States to exchange batches of messages or messages containing a

 
large number of requests or replies. These messages are dealt with in an asynchronous way.
 
6. The system queues asynchronous messages if the recipient State is temporarily unavailable

 
and guarantees the deliverance as soon as the recipient is up again.
 
7. The system stores incoming asynchronous messages until they can be processed.
8. The system only gives access to Eucaris applications of other States, not to individual

 
organisations within those other States, i.e. each Registration Authority acts as the single
gateway between its national end-users and the corresponding Authorities in the other
States.
 
9. It is possible to define users of different States on one Eucaris server and to authorise them

 
following the rights of that State.
 
10. Information on the requesting State, organisation and end user are included in the

 
messages.
 
11. The system facilitates logging of the exchange of messages between the different States and

 
between the core application and the national registration systems.
 
12. The system allows a specific secretary, which is an organisation or State explicitly appointed

 
for this task, to gather logged information on messages sent/received by all the participating
States, in order to produce statistical reports.
 
13. Each State indicates itself what logged information is made available for the secretary and

 
what information is ‘private’.
 
14. The system allows the National Administrators of each State to extract statistics of use.
15. The system enables addition of new States through simple administrative tasks.

No rights may be derived from it until the date of application. The numbering of the articles is provisional._

3.2.2. _Usability_

No Description

16. The system provides an interface for automated processing of messages by back-end

 
systems/legacy and enables the integration of the user interface in those systems
(customised user-interface).
 
17. The system is easy to learn, self-explanatory and contains help-text.
18. The system is documented to assist States in integration, operational activities and future

 
maintenance (e.g. reference guides, functional/technical documentation, operational guide,
...).
 
19. The user interface is multi-lingual and offers facilities for the end-user to select a preferred

 
language.
 
20. The user interface contains facilities for a Local Administrator to translate both screen-items

 
and coded information to the national language.
 
3.2.3. _Reliability_

No Description

21. The system is designed as a robust and dependable operational system which is tolerant to

 
operator errors and which will recover cleanly from power cuts or other disasters. It shall be
possible to restart the system with no or minimal loss of data.
 
22. The system shall give stable and reproducible results.
23. The system has been designed to function reliably. It is possible to implement the system in

 
a configuration that guarantees an availability of 98 % (by redundancy, the use of back-up
servers, etc.) in each bilateral communication.
 
24. It is possible to use part of the system, even during failure of some components (if State C is

 
down, States A and B are still able to communicate). The number of single points of failure in
the information chain should be minimised.
 
25. The recovery time after a severe failure should be less than one day. It should be possible to

 
minimise down-time by using remote support, e.g. by a central service desk.
 

_This document has been agreed between the European Union and the United Kingdom and is provided for information only.
No rights may be derived from it until the date of application. The numbering of the articles is provisional._

3.2.4. _Performance_

No Description

26. The system can be used 24x7. This time-window (24x7) is then also required from the States'

 
legacy systems.
 
27. The system responds rapidly to user requests irrespective of any background tasks. This is

 
also required from the Parties legacy systems to ensure acceptable response time. An overall
response time of 10 seconds maximum for a single request is acceptable.
 
28. The system has been designed as a multi-user system and in such a way that background

 
tasks can continue while the user performs foreground tasks.
 
29. The system has been designed to be scaleable in order to support the potential increase of

 
number of messages when new functionality is added or new organisations or States are
added.
 
3.2.5. _Security_

No Description

30. The system is suited (e.g. in its security measures) for the exchange of messages containing

 
privacy-sensitive personal data (e.g. car owner/holders), classified as EU restricted.
 
31. The system is maintained in such a way that unauthorised access to the data is prevented.
32. The system contains a service for the management of the rights and permissions of national

 
end-users.
 
33. States are able to check the identity of the sender (at State level), by means of XML-signing.
34. States shall explicitly authorise other States to request specific information.
35. The system provides at application level a full security and encryption policy compatible with

 
the level of security required in such situations. Exclusiveness and integrity of the
information is guaranteed by the use of XML-signing and encryption by means of SSL-
tunnelling.
 
36. All exchange of messages can be traced by means of logging.
37. Protection is provided against deletion attacks (a third party deletes a message) and replay

 
or insertion attacks (a third party replays or inserts a message).
 

_This document has been agreed between the European Union and the United Kingdom and is provided for information only.
No rights may be derived from it until the date of application. The numbering of the articles is provisional._

38. The system makes use of certificates of a Trusted Third Party (TTP).
39. The system is able to handle different certificates per State, depending on the type of

 
message or service.
 
40. The security measures at application level are sufficient to allow the use of non-accredited

 
networks.
 
41. The system is able to use novice security techniques such as an XML-firewall.

3.2.6. _Adaptability_

No Description

42. The system is extensible with new messages and new functionality. The costs of adaptations

 
are minimal. Due to the centralised development of application components.

The objective of this Annex is to lay down the necessary procedural and technical provisions for the
implementation of Title IX [Exchange of criminal record information] of Part Three.

 
Article 2: Communications network
 
1. The electronic exchange of information extracted from the criminal record between, on the
one side, a Member State and, on the other side, the United Kingdom shall take place using a
common communication infrastructure that provides for encrypted communications.
2. The common communication infrastructure shall be the Trans European Services for
Telematics between Administrations (TESTA) communications network. Any further developments
thereof or any alternative secure network shall ensure that the common communication
infrastructure in place continues to fulfil the security requirements adequate for the exchange of
criminal record information.

 
Article 3: Interconnection software
 
1. The States shall use a standardised interconnection software enabling the connection of
their central authorities to the common communication infrastructure in order to exchange the
information extracted from the criminal record with the other States electronically in accordance
with the provisions of Title IX [Exchange of criminal record information] of Part Three and this
Annex.
2. For the Member States, the interconnection software shall be the ECRIS reference
implementation software or their national ECRIS implementation software, if necessary adapted for
the purposes of information exchange with the United Kingdom as set out in this Agreement.
3. The United Kingdom shall be responsible for the development and operation of its own
interconnection software. For that purpose, at the latest before the entry into force of this
Agreement, the United Kingdom shall ensure that its national interconnection software functions in
accordance with the protocols and technical specifications established for the ECRIS reference
implementation software, and with any further technical requirements established by eu-LISA.
4. The United Kingdom shall also ensure the implementation of any subsequent technical
adaptations to its national interconnection software required by any changes to the technical
specifications established for the ECRIS reference implementation software, or changes to any
further technical requirements established by eu-LISA, without undue delay. To that end, the Union
shall ensure that the United Kingdom is informed without undue delay of any planned changes to
the technical specifications or requirements and is provided with any information necessary for the
United Kingdom to comply with its obligations under this Annex.

(a) the amounts in commitment appropriations in the Union budget definitively adopted for the
year in question for the budget lines covering participation of the United Kingdom in
accordance with Protocol I [Programmes and activities in which the United Kingdom
participates] of this Agreement and, if relevant, the amount of external assigned
appropriations that do not result from financial contribution from other donors on these
budget lines;

(b) the amount of the participation fee referred to in Article UNPRO.2.1 (4)[Financial conditions]
of this Agreement;

(d) for programmes to which Article UNPRO.2.2 [Programmes to which an automatic correction
mechanism applies] applies, for the part of the programmes where such information is
necessary to calculate the automatic correction, the level of commitments entered into in
favour of United Kingdom entities broken down according to the corresponding year of
budgetary appropriations and the related total level of commitments.

On the basis of its Draft Budget, the Commission shall provide an estimate of information under
points (a) and (b) as soon as possible, and, at the latest, by 1 September of the financial year.

2. The Commission shall issue, at the latest on 16 April and on 16 July of each financial year, a

3. The United Kingdom shall pay the amount indicated in the call for funds at the latest 60 days
after the call for funds is issued. The United Kingdom may make separate payments for each

6. By derogation from paragraph 5, in relation to the contribution to Horizon Europe for the

correction under Articles UNPRO.2.2 [Programmes to which an automatic correction mechanism

For all the calculations of other amounts related to Part V of this Agreement, the annual contribution
