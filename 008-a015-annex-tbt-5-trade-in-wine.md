Organisation of the Vine and Wine (“OIV”) shall be considered relevant international standards for
the purposes of this Annex.

other Party, if that wine has been produced in accordance with:
    (a) product definitions authorised in each Party under the laws and regulations referred to in Appendix A;
    (b) the oenological practices established in each Party under the laws and regulations referred to in Appendix A that are in accordance with the relevant OIV standards; and

1. Unless otherwise specified in this Article, labelling of wine imported and marketed under
this Agreement shall be conducted in compliance with the laws and regulations that apply in the

label affixed to a wine container. Supplementary labels may be affixed to a wine container after
importation but prior to the product being placed on the market in the Party's territory, provided
that the mandatory information is fully and accurately displayed.

5. The importing Party shall not require the display on the label of allergens which have been
used in the production of wine but are not present in the final product.
