The Specialised Committee on Fisheries shall decide on the details of this mechanism. The Parties shall consider making transfers of fishing opportunities for stocks which are, or are projected to be, underfished available at market value through this mechanism.

##### Article FISH.7: Provisional TACs
1. If the Parties have not agreed a TAC for a stock listed in Annex FISH.1 or Annex FISH.2A or B by 10 December, they shall immediately resume consultations with the continued aim of agreeing the TAC. The Parties shall engage frequently with a view to exploring all possible options for reaching agreement in the shortest possible time.

2. If a stock listed in Annex FISH.1 or Annex FISH.2A and B remains without an agreed TAC on 20 December, each Party shall set a provisional TAC corresponding to the level advised by ICES, applying from 1 January.

3. By derogation from paragraph 2, the TACs for special stocks shall be set in accordance with guidelines adopted under paragraph 5.

4. For the purposes of this article, “special stocks” means:
    (a) stocks where the ICES advice is for a zero TAC;
    (b) stocks caught in a mixed fishery, if that stock or another stock in the same fishery is vulnerable; or
    (c.) other stocks which the Parties consider require special treatment.

5. The Specialised Committee on Fisheries shall adopt guidelines by 1 July 2021 for the setting of provisional TACs for special stocks.

6. Each year when advice is received from ICES on TACs, the Parties shall discuss, as a priority, the special stocks and the application of any guidelines set under paragraph 5 to the setting of provisional TACs by each Party.

7. Each Party shall set its share for each of the provisional TACs, which shall not exceed its share as set out in the corresponding Annex.

9. Each Party shall, immediately, notify the other Party of its provisional TACs under paragraphs 2 and 3 and its provisional share of each of those TACs under paragraph 7.

##### Article FISH.8: Access to waters
1. Provided that TACs have been agreed each Party shall grant vessels of the other Party access to fish in its waters in the relevant ICES sub-areas that year. Access shall be granted at a level and on conditions determined in those annual consultations.

2. The Parties may agree, in annual consultations, further specific access conditions in relation to:
    (a) the fishing opportunities agreed;
    (b) any multi-year strategies for non-quota stocks developed under point (c.) of Article FISH.16(1) [Specialised Committee on Fisheries]; and
    (c.) any technical and conservation measures agreed by the Parties, without prejudice to Article FISH.4 [Fisheries management].

3. The Parties shall conduct the annual consultations, including on the level and conditions of access referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, in good faith and with the objective of ensuring a mutually satisfactory balance between the interests of both Parties.

4. In particular, the outcome of the consultations should normally result in each Party granting:
    (a) access to fish the stocks listed in Annex FISH.1 and Annex FISH.2.A, B and F in each other’s EEZ (or if access is granted under point (c), in EEZs and in the divisions mentioned in that point) at a level that is reasonably commensurate with the Parties’ respective shares of the TACs;
    (b) access to fish non-quota stocks in each other’s EEZ (or if access is granted under point (c.), in EEZs and in the divisions mentioned in that point), at a level that at least equates to the average tonnage fished by that Party in the waters of the other Party during the period 2012-2016; and
    (c.) access to the waters of the Parties between six and twelve nautical miles from the baseline in ICES divisions 4c and 7d-g for qualifying vessels to the extent that Union fishing vessels and United Kingdom fishing vessels had access to those waters on 31 December 2020.
For the purposes of point (c.), ‘qualifying vessel’ means a vessel of a Party which fished in the zone mentioned in the previous sentence in four of the years between 2012 and 2016, or its direct replacement.
Annual consultations referred to in point (c.) may include appropriate financial commitments and quota transfers between the Parties.

5. During the application of a provisional TAC, and pending an agreed TAC, the Parties shall grant provisional access to fish in the relevant ICES sub-areas as follows
    (a) for stocks listed in Annex FISH.1 and non-quota stocks, from 1 January until 31 March at the levels provided for in paragraph 4(a) and (b);
    (b) for stocks listed in Annex FISH.2 from 1 January until 14 February at the levels provided for in paragraph 4(a); and
    (c.) in relation to access to fish in the six to twelve nautical miles zone, access in accordance with paragraph 4(c) from 1 January to 31 January at a level equivalent to the average monthly tonnage fished in that zone in the previous 3 months.
Such access, for each of the relevant stocks in points (a) and (b), shall be in proportion to the average percentage of a Party’s share of the annual TAC which that Party’s vessels fished in the other Party’s waters in the relevant ICES sub-areas during the same period of the previous three calendar years. The same shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to access to fish non-quota stocks.
By 15 January in relation to the situation in point (c) of this paragraph, by 31 January in respect of the stocks listed in Annex FISH.2, and by 15 March in respect of all other stocks, each Party shall notify the other Party of the change in the level and conditions of access to waters that will apply as of 1 February in relation to the situation in point (c), as of 15 February in respect of the stocks listed in Annex FISH.2, and as of 1 April in respect of all other stocks for the relevant ICES sub-areas.

6. Without prejudice to Article FISH.7(1) and (8)[Provisional TACs], after the period of one month in relation to the situation in point (c) of paragraph 5, one and a half months in respect of the stocks listed in Annex FISH.2 and three months in respect of all other stocks, the Parties shall seek to agree further provisional access arrangements at the appropriate geographical level with the aim of minimising disruption to fishing activities.

7. In granting access under paragraph 1, a Party may take into account compliance of individual or groups of vessels with the applicable rules in its waters during the preceding year, and measures taken by the other Party pursuant to Article FISH.5(2) [Authorisations, compliance and enforcement] during the preceding year.

8. This Article shall apply subject to Annex FISH.4 [Protocol on access to waters].

##### Article FISH.9: Compensatory measures in case of withdrawal or reduction of access
1. Following a notification by a Party (“host Party”) under Article FISH.8(5)[Access to waters], the other Party (“fishing Party”) may take compensatory measures commensurate to the economic and societal impact of the change in the level and conditions of access to waters. Such impact shall be measured on the basis of reliable evidence and not merely on conjecture and remote possibility. Giving priority to those compensatory measures which will least disturb the functioning of this Agreement, the fishing Party may suspend, in whole or in part, access to its waters and the preferential tariff treatment granted to fishery products under Article GOODS.5[Prohibition and customs duties].

2. A compensatory measure referred to in paragraph 1 may take effect at the earliest seven days after the fishing Party has given notice to the host Party of the intended suspension under paragraph 1 and, in any case, not earlier than 1 February in relation to the situation in point (c) of Article 8(5)[Access to waters], 15 February in respect of Annex FISH.2 and 1 April in respect of other stocks. The Parties shall consult within the Specialised Committee with a view to reaching a mutually agreeable solution. That notification shall identify:
    (a) the date upon which the fishing Party intends to suspend; and
    (b) the obligations to be suspended and the level of the intended suspension.

3. After the notification of the compensatory measures in accordance with paragraph 2, the host Party may request the establishment of an arbitration tribunal pursuant to Article INST.14 [Arbitration procedure] of Title I [Dispute settlement] of Part Six, without having recourse to consultations in accordance with Article INST.13 [Consultations]. The arbitration tribunal may only review the conformity of the compensatory measures with paragraph 1. The arbitration tribunal shall treat the issue as a case of urgency for the purpose of Article INST.19 [Urgent proceedings] of Title I [Dispute settlement] of Part Six.

4. When the conditions for taking compensatory measures referred to in paragraph 1 are no longer met, such measures shall be withdrawn immediately.

5. Following a finding against the fishing Party in the procedure referred to in paragraph 3, the host Party may request the arbitration tribunal, within 30 days from its ruling, to determine a level of suspension of obligations under this Agreement not exceeding the level equivalent to the nullification or impairment caused by the application of the compensatory measures, if it finds that the inconsistency of the compensatory measures with paragraph 1 is significant. The request shall propose a level of suspension in accordance with the principles set out in paragraph 1 and any relevant principles set out in Article INST.34C [Suspension of obligations for the purposes of LPFS.3.12(12), Article FISH.9(5) and Article FISH.14(7)]. The host Party may apply the level of suspension of obligations under this Agreement in accordance with the level of suspension determined by the arbitration tribunal, no sooner than 15 days following such ruling.

6. A Party shall not invoke the WTO Agreement or any other international agreement to preclude the other Party from suspending obligations under this Article.

The Union shall apply the following notification periods to fisheries products caught by vessels flying the flag of the United Kingdom and registered in the Bailiwick of Guernsey or the Bailiwick of Jersey in the territorial sea adjacent to those territories or in the territorial sea adjacent to a Member State:
    (a) prior notification between three and five hours before landing fresh fisheries products into the Union’s territory;
    (b) prior notification between one and three hours of the validated catch certificate for the direct movement of consignments of fisheries products by sea before the estimated time of arrival at the place of entry into the Union’s territory.

2. For the purposes of this Article only, “fisheries products” means all species of marine fish, molluscs and crustaceans.

##### Article FISH.12: Alignment of management areas
1. By 1 July 2021, the Parties shall request advice from ICES on the alignment of the management areas and the assessment units used by ICES for the stocks marked with an asterisk in Annex FISH.1.

2. Within six months of receipt of the advice referred to in paragraph 1, the Parties shall jointly review that advice and shall jointly consider adjustments to the management areas of the stocks concerned, with a view to agreeing consequential changes to the list of stocks and shares set out in Annex FISH.1.

##### Article FISH.13: Shares of TACs for certain other stocks
1. The Parties’ respective shares of the TACs for certain other stocks are set out in Annex FISH.2.

2. Each Party shall notify the relevant States and international organisations of its shares in accordance with the sharing arrangement set out in Annex FISH.2A to D.
