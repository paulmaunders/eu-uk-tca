Date of transmission:

### Section 3 : Recovery assistance
### Article 3.1: Communication
A request sent by electronic means for the application of Title III of the Protocol shall be sent between the CCN mailboxes that are set up for the type of tax or duty to which the request relates, unless the central liaison offices of the applicant and requested States agree that one of the mailboxes can be used for requests concerning different types of taxes or duties.

However, if a request for notification of documents relates to more than one type of tax or duty, the applicant authority shall send that request to a mailbox set up for at least one of the types of claims mentioned in the documents to be notified.

### Article 3.2: Implementing rules relating to the uniform instrument permitting enforcement in the requested State
1. The administrative penalties, fines, fees and surcharges and the interest and costs referred to in point (b) of paragraph 1 of Article 2 of the Protocol which, in accordance with the rules in force in the applicant State, may be due from the date of the initial instrument permitting enforcement until the day before the date on which the recovery request is sent, may be added in the uniform instrument permitting enforcement in the requested State.

2. A single uniform instrument permitting enforcement in the requested State may be issued in respect of several claims and several persons, corresponding to the initial instrument or instruments permitting enforcement in the applicant State.

3. In so far as initial instruments permitting enforcement for several claims in the applicant State have already been replaced by a global instrument permitting enforcement for all those claims in that State, the uniform instrument permitting enforcement in the requested State may be based on the initial instruments permitting enforcement in the applicant State or on that global instrument regrouping those initial instruments in the applicant State.

4. Where the initial instrument referred to in paragraph 2 or the global instrument referred to in paragraph 3 contains several claims, one or more of which have already been collected or

_This document has been agreed between the European Union and the United Kingdom and is provided for information only.
No rights may be derived from it until the date of application. The numbering of the articles is provisional._

recovered, the uniform instrument permitting enforcement in the requested State shall only refer to those claims for which recovery assistance is requested.

5. Where the initial instrument referred to in paragraph 2 or the global instrument referred to in paragraph 3 contains several claims, the applicant authority may list those claims in different uniform instruments permitting enforcement in the requested State, in line with the tax type related division of competences of the respective recovery offices in the requested State.

6. If a request cannot be transmitted by CCN network and is transmitted by post, the uniform instrument permitting enforcement in the requested State shall be signed by a duly authorised official of the applicant authority.

### Article 3.3: Conversion of the sums to be recovered
1. The applicant authority shall express the amount of the claim to be recovered in the currency of the applicant State and in the currency of the requested State.

2. For requests sent to the United Kingdom, the exchange rate to be used for the purposes of the recovery assistance shall be the exchange rate published by the European Central Bank on the day before the date on which the request is sent. Where there is no such rate available on that date, the exchange rate used shall be the latest exchange rate published by the European Central Bank before the date the request is sent.
For requests sent to a Member State, the exchange rate to be used for the purposes of the recovery assistance shall be the exchange rate published by the Bank of England on the day before the date on which the request is sent. Where there is no such rate available on that date, the exchange rate used shall be the latest exchange rate published by the Bank of England before the date the request is sent.

3. In order to convert the amount of the claim resulting from the adjustment, referred to in paragraph 2 of Article 30 of the Protocol, into the currency of the State of the requested authority, the applicant authority shall use the exchange rate used in its initial request.

### Article 3.4: Transfer of recovered amounts
1. The transfer of the recovered amounts shall take place within two months of the date on which recovery was effected, unless otherwise agreed between the States.

2. However, if recovery measures applied by the requested authority are contested for a reason not falling within the responsibility of the applicant State, the requested authority may wait to transfer any sums recovered in relation to the applicant State’s claim, until the dispute is settled, if the following conditions are simultaneously fulfilled:
    (a) the requested authority finds it likely that the outcome of this contestation will be favourable to the party concerned; and
    (b) the applicant authority has not declared that it will reimburse the sums already transferred if the outcome of that contestation is favourable to the party concerned.

3. If the applicant authority has made a declaration to reimburse in accordance with point (b) of the second paragraph, it shall return the recovered amounts already transferred by the requested

_This document has been agreed between the European Union and the United Kingdom and is provided for information only.
No rights may be derived from it until the date of application. The numbering of the articles is provisional._

authority within one month of the receipt of the request for reimbursement. Any other compensation due shall, in that case, be borne solely by the requested authority.

### Article 3.5: Reimbursement of recovered amounts
The requested authority shall notify any action taken in the requested State for reimbursement of sums recovered or for compensation in relation to recovery of contested claims to the applicant authority immediately after the requested authority has been informed of such action.
The requested authority shall as far as possible involve the applicant authority in the procedures for settling the amount to be reimbursed and the compensation due. Upon receipt of a reasoned request from the requested authority, the applicant authority shall transfer the sums reimbursed and the compensation paid within two months of the receipt of that request.

### Article 3.6: Standard forms
