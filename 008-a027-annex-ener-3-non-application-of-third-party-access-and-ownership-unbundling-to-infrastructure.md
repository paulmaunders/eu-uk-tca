##### ANNEX ENER-3: NON-APPLICATION OF THIRD-PARTY ACCESS AND OWNERSHIP UNBUNDLING TO

##### INFRASTRUCTURE

A Party may decide not to apply Article ENER.8 [Third-party access to transmission and distribution
networks] and Article ENER.9 [System operation and unbundling of transmission network operators]
to new infrastructure or to a significant expansion of existing infrastructure where:

(a) the risk attached to the investment in the infrastructure is such that the investment would not

 
take place unless an exemption is granted;
 
(b) the investment enhances competition or security of supply;

(c) the infrastructure is owned by a natural or legal person separate, at least in terms of its legal

 
form, from the system operators in whose systems it was or is to be built;
 
(d) before granting the exemption, the Party has decided on the rules and mechanisms for

 
management and allocation of capacity.
