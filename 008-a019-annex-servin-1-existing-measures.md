### ANNEX SERVIN-1: EXISTING MEASURES

**Headnotes**

1. The Schedules of the United Kingdom and the Union set out, under Article SERVIN 2.7 [Non-
conforming measures – Investment liberalisation], Article SERVIN.3.6 [Non-conforming measures –
Cross-border trade in services], and Article SERVIN 5.50 [Non-conforming measures – Legal services]
the reservations taken by the United Kingdom and the Union with respect to existing measures that
do not conform with obligations imposed by:
    (a) Articles SERVIN.2.2 [Market access– Investment liberalisation] or SERVIN.3.2 [Market
access - Cross-border trade in services];
    (b) Article SERVIN.3.3 [Local presence – Cross-border trade in services;
    (c.) Articles SERVIN.2.3 [National treatment– Investment liberalisation] or SERVIN.3.
[National treatment - Cross-border trade in services];
    (d) Articles SERVIN.2.4 [Most-favoured-nation treatment– Investment liberalisation], or
SERVIN.3.5 [Most-favoured-nation treatment - Cross-border trade in services];
    (e) Article SERVIN.2.5 [Senior management and boards of directors];
    (f) Article SERVIN.2.6 [Performance requirements]; or
    (g) Article SERVIN.5.49 [Obligations – Legal services].

2. The reservations of a Party are without prejudice to the rights and obligations of the Parties under
GATS.

3. Each reservation sets out the following elements:
(a) "sector" refers to the general sector in which the reservation is taken;
(b) "sub-sector" refers to the specific sector in which the reservation is taken;
(c.) "industry classification" refers, where applicable, to the activity covered by the
reservation according to the CPC, ISIC Rev. 3.1, or as expressly otherwise described in
that reservation;
(d) "type of reservation" specifies the obligation referred to in paragraph 1 for which a
reservation is taken;
(e) "level of government" indicates the level of government maintaining the measure for
which a reservation is taken;
(f) "measures" identifies the laws or other measures as qualified, where indicated, by the
"description" element for which the reservation is taken. A "measure" cited in the
"measures" element:
    (i) means the measure as amended, continued or renewed as of the date of entry
into force of this Agreement;
    (ii) includes any subordinate measure adopted or maintained under the authority of
and consistent with the measure; and
    (iii) in respect of the schedule of the European Union, includes any laws or other
measures which implement a directive at Member State level; and
(g) "description" sets out the non-conforming aspects of the existing measure for which the
reservation is taken.

4. For greater certainty, if a Party adopts a new measure at a level of government different to
that at which the reservation was originally taken, and this new measure effectively replaces –
within the territory to which it applies – the non-conforming aspect of the original measure cited in
the ‘measures’ element, the new measure shall be deemed to constitute ‘modification’ to the
original measure within the meaning of Article SERVIN.2.7(1)(c) [Non-conforming measures –
Investment liberalisation]; Article SERVIN.3.6(1)(c) [Non-conforming measures – Cross-border trade
in services]; Article 4.5(c) [Non-conforming measures – Entry and temporary stay of natural persons
for business purposes] and Article SERVIN.5.50 [Non-conforming measures – Legal services].

5. In the interpretation of a reservation, all elements of the reservation shall be considered. A
reservation shall be interpreted in the light of the relevant obligations of the Chapters or Sections
against which the reservation is taken. The "measures" element shall prevail over all other elements.

6. For the purposes of the Schedules of the United Kingdom and the Union:
(a) “ISIC Rev. 3.1” means the International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic
Activities as set out in Statistical Office of the United Nations, Statistical Papers, Series
M, No.4, ISIC Rev. 3.1, 2002;
(b) “CPC” means the Provisional Central Product Classification (Statistical Papers, Series M
No. 77, Department of International Economic and Social Affairs, Statistical Office of the
United Nations, New York, 1991).

7. For the purposes of the Schedules of the United Kingdom and the Union, a reservation for a
requirement to have a local presence in the territory of the Union or the United Kingdom is taken
against Article SERVIN 3.3 [Local presence], and not against Article SERVIN 3.2 [Market access] or
SERVIN 3.4 [National treatment]. Furthermore, such a requirement is not taken as a reservation
against Article SERVIN 2.3 [National treatment].

8. A reservation taken at the level of the Union applies to a measure of the Union, to a
measure of a Member State at the central level or to a measure of a government within a Member
State, unless the reservation excludes a Member State. A reservation taken by a Member State
applies to a measure of a government at the central, regional or local level within that Member
State. For the purposes of the reservations of Belgium, the central level of government covers the
federal government and the governments of the regions and the communities as each of them holds
equipollent legislative powers. For the purposes of the reservations of the Union and its Member
States, a regional level of government in Finland means the Åland Islands. A reservation taken at the
level of the United Kingdom applies to a measure of the central government, a regional government
or a local government.

9. The list of reservations below does not include measures relating to qualification
requirements and procedures, technical standards and licensing requirements and procedures
where they do not constitute a limitation within the meaning of Article SERVIN.2.2 [Market access –
Investment liberalisation], Article SERVIN.2.3 [National treatment – Investment liberalisation],
Article SERVIN.3.2 [Market access – Cross-border trade in services], Article SERVIN.3.3 [Local
presence – Cross-border trade in services], Article SERVIN.3.4 [National treatment – Cross-border trade in services] or Article SERVIN 5.49 [Obligations – Legal services]. These measures may include,
in particular, the need to obtain a licence, to satisfy universal service obligations, to have recognised
qualifications in regulated sectors, to pass specific examinations, including language examinations,
to fulfil a membership requirement of a particular profession, such as membership in a professional
organisation, to have a local agent for service, or to maintain a local address, or any other non-
discriminatory requirements that certain activities may not be carried out in protected zones or
areas. While not listed, such measures continue to apply.

10. For greater certainty, for the Union, the obligation to grant national treatment does not
entail the requirement to extend to natural or legal persons of the United Kingdom the treatment
granted in a Member State, pursuant to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, or any
measure adopted pursuant to that Treaty, including their implementation in the Member States, to:
(i) natural persons or residents of another Member State; or
(ii) legal persons constituted or organised under the law of another Member State or of the
Union and having their registered office, central administration or principal place of
business in the Union.

11. Treatment granted to legal persons established by investors of a Party in accordance with
the law of the other Party (including, in the case of the Union, the law of a Member State) and
having their registered office, central administration or principal place of business within that other
Party, is without prejudice to any condition or obligation, consistent with Chapter 2 [Investment
liberalisation] of Title II [Services and investment] of Heading One [Trade] of Part Two [Trade,
transport and fisheries], which may have been imposed on such legal person when it was
established in that other Party, and which shall continue to apply.

12. The schedules apply only to the territories of the United Kingdom and the Union in
accordance with Article FINPROV.1[Territorial scope] and Article OTH.9(2) [Geographical scope] and
are only relevant in the context of trade relations between the Union and its Member States with
the United Kingdom. They do not affect the rights and obligations of the Member States under
Union law.

13. For greater certainty, non-discriminatory measures do not constitute a market access
limitation within the meaning of Articles SERVIN. 2.2 [Market access – Investment liberalisation],
SERVIN.3.2 [Market access – Cross-border trade in services], or Article SERVIN.5.49 [Obligations –
Legal services] for any measure:
(a) requiring the separation of the ownership of infrastructure from the ownership of the
goods or services provided through that infrastructure to ensure fair competition, for
example in the fields of energy, transportation and telecommunications;
(b) restricting the concentration of ownership to ensure fair competition;
(c) seeking to ensure the conservation and protection of natural resources and the
environment, including a limitation on the availability, number and scope of concessions
granted, and the imposition of a moratorium or ban;
(d) limiting the number of authorisations granted because of technical or physical
constraints, for example telecommunications spectra and frequencies; or
(e) requiring that a certain percentage of the shareholders, owners, partners, or directors of
an enterprise be qualified or practice a certain profession such as lawyers or
accountants.

14. With respect to financial services: Unlike foreign subsidiaries, branches established directly
in a Member State by a non-European Union financial institution are not, with certain limited
exceptions, subject to prudential regulations harmonised at Union level which enable such
subsidiaries to benefit from enhanced facilities to set up new establishments and to provide cross-
border services throughout the Union. Therefore, such branches receive an authorisation to operate
in the territory of a Member State under conditions equivalent to those applied to domestic financial
institutions of that Member State, and may be required to satisfy a number of specific prudential
requirements such as, in the case of banking and securities, separate capitalisation and other
solvency requirements and reporting and publication of accounts requirements or, in the case of
insurance, specific guarantee and deposit requirements, a separate capitalisation, and the
localisation in the Member State concerned of the assets representing the technical reserves and at
least one third of the solvency margin.

property will be permitted if the applicant is going to use the real property as his or her primary
residence.

For legal persons that are not registered in Denmark, acquisition of real property will in general be
permitted, if the acquisition is a prerequisite for the business activities of the purchaser. Permission
is also required if the applicant is going to use the real property as a secondary dwelling. Such
permission will only be granted if the applicant through an overall and concrete assessment is
regarded to have particular strong ties to Denmark.

Agricultural Holdings Act, which imposes restrictions on all persons, Danish or foreign, when
acquiring agricultural property. Accordingly, any natural or legal person, who wishes to acquire
agricultural real property, must fulfil the requirements in this Act. This generally means a limited
residence requirement on the agricultural holding applies. The residence requirement is not
personal. Legal entities must be of the types listed in §20 and §21 of the act and must be registered

production of agricultural products listed in Annex I to the Treaty on the Functioning of the
European Union, except fishery products and cotton (hereinafter agricultural product).

iii. ten hectares or more of forest land if the legal person has been engaged, for three years
immediately preceding the year of making the transaction of acquisition of the immovable, in
forest management within the meaning of the Forest Act (hereinafter forest management) or
production of agricultural products.

iv. less than ten hectares of agricultural land and less than ten hectares of forest land, but ten
hectares or more of agricultural and forest land in total, if the legal person has been engaged, for three years immediately preceding the year of making the transaction of acquisition of the

If a legal person does not meet the requirements provided for in (ii)–(iv), the legal person may
acquire an immovable which contains ten hectares or more of agricultural land, forest land or
agricultural and forest land in total only with the authorisation of the council of the local
government of the location of the immovable to be acquired.

Restrictions on acquiring immovable property apply in certain geographical areas for non-EEA
nationals.

In EL : Real estate acquisition or tenancy in the border regions is prohibited to natural or legal
persons whose nationality or base is outside the Member States and the European Free Trade
Association. The ban may be lifted with a discretionary decision taken by a committee of the
appropriate Decentralized Administration (or the Minister of National Defense in case the properties
to be exploited belong to the Fund for the Exploitation of Private Public Property)..

In HR : Foreign companies are only allowed to acquire real estate for the supply of services if they are
established and incorporated in Croatia as legal persons. Acquisition of real estate necessary for the
supply of services by branches requires the approval of the Ministry of Justice. Agricultural land
cannot be acquired by foreigners.

In MT : Non-nationals of a Member State may not acquire immovable property for commercial
purposes. Companies with 25 per cent (or more) of non-European Union shareholding must obtain

property for commercial or business purposes. The competent authority will determine whether the
proposed acquisition represents a net benefit to the Maltese economy.

In PL : The acquisition of real estate, direct and indirect, by foreigners requires a permit. A permit is
issued through an administrative decision by a minister competent in internal affairs, with the
consent of the Minister of National Defence, and in the case of agricultural real estate, also with the
consent of the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development.

have specific exploration and mining rules. Prior to any exploitation activity, a permit for exploration
is needed ("permesso di ricerca", Article 4 Royal Decree 1447/1927). This permit has a duration,
defines exactly the borders of the ground under exploration and more than one exploration permit
may be granted for the same area to different persons or companies (this type of licence is not
necessarily exclusive). In order to cultivate and exploit minerals, an authorisation ("concessione",
Article 14) from the regional authority is required (ISIC Rev. 3.1 10, 3.1 11, 3.1 12, 3.1 13, 3.1 14, CPC

In **BG** : The activities of prospecting or exploration of underground natural resources on the territory
of the Republic of Bulgaria, in the continental shelf and in the exclusive economic zone in the Black
Sea are subject to permission, while the activities of extraction and exploitation are subject to
concession granted under the Underground Natural Resources Act.

It is forbidden for companies registered in preferential tax treatment jurisdictions (that is, offshore
zones) or related, directly or indirectly, to such companies to participate in open procedures for
granting permits or concessions for prospecting, exploration or extraction of natural resources,
including uranium and thorium ores, as well as to operate an existing permit or concession which
has been granted, as such operations are precluded, including the possibility to register the
geological or commercial discovery of a deposit as a result of exploration.

The mining of uranium ore is closed by Decree of the Council of Ministers No. 163 of 20.08.1992.

With regard to exploration and mining of thorium ore, the general regime of permits and
concessions applies. Decisions to allow the exploration or mining of thorium ore are taken on a non-
discriminatory individual case-by-case basis.

nation treatment:

In **CY** : The Council of Ministers may refuse to allow the activities of prospecting, exploration and
exploitation of hydrocarbons to be carried out by any entity which is effectively controlled by the
United Kingdom or by nationals of the United Kingdom. After the granting of an authorisation, no
entity may come under the direct or indirect control of the United Kingdom or a national of the
United Kingdom without the prior approval of the Council of Ministers. The Council of Ministers may


refuse to grant an authorisation to an entity which is effectively controlled by the United Kingdom or
by a national of the United Kingdom, if the United Kingdom does not grant entities of the Republic or
entities of Member States as regards access to and exercise of the activities of prospecting, exploring
for and exploiting hydrocarbons, treatment comparable to that which the Republic or Member State
grants entities from the United Kingdom (ISIC Rev 3.1 1110).

technologies. For greater certainty, such measures include the prohibition of the use of cyanide
leaching in the treatment or refining of minerals, the requirement of a specific authorisation in the
case of fracking for activities of prospecting, exploration or extraction of oil and gas, as well as prior
approval by local referendum in the case of nuclear/radioactive mineral resources. This does not
increase the non-conforming aspects of the existing measure for which the reservation is taken. (ISIC
