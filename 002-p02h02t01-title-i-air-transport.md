On arriving in the territory of one Party, aircraft operated in international air transport by the air carriers of the other Party, their regular equipment, fuel, lubricants, consumable technical supplies, ground equipment, spare parts (including engines), aircraft stores (including but not limited to such items as food, beverages and liquor, tobacco and other products destined for sale to, or use by, passengers in limited quantities during flight) and other items intended for or used solely in connection with the operation or servicing of aircraft engaged in international air transport shall, on the basis of reciprocity, and provided that such equipment and supplies remain on board the aircraft, be exempt from all import restrictions, property taxes and capital levies, customs duties, excise taxes, inspection fees, value added tax or other similar indirect taxes, and similar fees and charges imposed by the national or local authorities or the Union.

2. The following goods shall also be exempt, on the basis of reciprocity, from the taxes, levies, duties, fees and charges referred to in paragraph 1:
    (a) aircraft stores introduced into or supplied in the territory of a Party and taken on board, within reasonable limits, for use on outbound aircraft of an air carrier of the other Party used in international air transport, even when these stores are to be used on a part of the journey performed over the said territory;
    (b) ground equipment and spare parts (including engines) introduced into the territory of a Party for the servicing, maintenance, or repair of aircraft of an air carrier of the other Party used in international air transport;
    (c.) lubricants and consumable technical supplies other than fuel introduced into or supplied in the territory of a Party for use in an aircraft of an air carrier of the other Party used in international air transport, even when those supplies are to be used on a part of the journey performed over the said territory; and
    (d) printed matter, as provided for by the customs legislation of each Party, introduced into or supplied in the territory of one Party and taken on board for use on outbound aircraft of an air carrier of the other Party engaged in international air transport, even when those stores are to be used on a part of the journey performed over the said territory.

3. The regular airborne equipment, as well as the material, supplies and spare parts referred to in paragraph 1 normally retained on board aircraft operated by an air carrier of one Party may be unloaded in the territory of the other Party only with the approval of the customs authorities of that Party and may be required to be kept under the supervision or control of the said authorities up to such time as they are re-exported or otherwise disposed of in accordance with applicable regulations.

4. The relief from customs duties, national excise duties and similar national fees provided for in this Article shall also be available in situations where the air carrier or air carriers of one Party have entered into arrangements with another air carrier or air carriers for the loan or transfer in the territory of the other Party of the items specified in paragraphs 1 and 2, provided that such other air carrier or air carriers similarly enjoy such relief from that other Party.

5. Nothing in this Title shall prevent either Party from imposing taxes, levies, duties, fees or charges on goods sold other than for consumption on board to passengers during a sector of an air service between two points within its territory at which embarkation or disembarkation is permitted.

6. Baggage and cargo in direct transit across the territory of a Party shall be exempt from taxes, customs duties, fees and other similar charges.

##### Article AIRTRN.15: User charges
1. User charges that may be imposed by one Party on the air carriers of the other Party for the use of air navigation and air traffic control shall be cost-related and non-discriminatory. In any event, any such user charges shall be assessed on the air carriers of the other Party on terms not less favourable than the most favourable terms available to any other air carrier in like circumstances at the time the charges are applied.

2. Without prejudice to Article AIRTRN.13(5) [Commercial Operations], each Party shall ensure that user charges other than those mentioned in paragraph 1 that may be imposed on the air carriers of the other Party are just, reasonable, not unjustly discriminatory, and equitably apportioned among categories of users. User charges imposed on the air carriers of the other Party may reflect, but not exceed, the full cost of providing appropriate airport, airport environmental and aviation security facilities and services at the airport or within the airport system. Such charges may include a reasonable return on assets after depreciation. Facilities and services for which user charges are imposed shall be provided on an efficient and economic basis. In any event, any such user charges shall be assessed on the air carrier of the other Party on terms no less favourable than the most favourable terms available to any other air carrier in like circumstances at the time the charges are applied.

3. In order to ensure the correct application of the principles set out in paragraphs 1 and 2, each Party shall ensure that consultations take place between the competent charging authorities or bodies in its territory and the air carriers using the services and facilities concerned and that the competent charging authorities or bodies and the air carriers exchange such information as may be necessary. Each Party shall ensure that the competent charging authorities provide users with reasonable notice of any proposal for changes in user charges to enable users to express their views before any changes are made.

##### Article AIRTRN.16: Tariffs
1. The Parties shall allow tariffs to be freely established by the air carriers of the Parties on the basis of fair competition in accordance with this Title.

2. The Parties shall not subject the tariffs of each other’s air carriers to approval.

##### Article AIRTRN.17: Statistics

2. Upon request, each Party shall provide the other Party with non-confidential and non-commercially sensitive available statistics related to air transport under this Title, as required by the respective laws and regulations of the Parties, on a non-discriminatory basis, and as may reasonably be required.

##### Article AIRTRN.18: Aviation safety
1. The Parties reaffirm the importance of close cooperation in the field of aviation safety.

2. Certificates of airworthiness, certificates of competency and licences issued or rendered valid by one Party and still in force shall be recognised as valid by the other Party and its competent authorities, for the purpose of operating air services under this Title, provided that such certificates or licences were issued or rendered valid pursuant to, and in conformity with, as a minimum, the relevant international standards established under the Convention.

3. Each Party may request consultations at any time concerning the safety standards maintained and administered by the other Party in areas relating to aeronautical facilities, flight crew, aircraft and the operation of aircraft. Such consultations shall take place within 30 days of the request.

4. If, following such consultations, one Party finds that the other Party does not effectively maintain and administer safety standards in the areas referred to in paragraph 2 that are at least equal to the minimum standards established at that time pursuant to the Convention, the first Party shall notify the other Party of those findings and the steps considered necessary to conform with those minimum standards, and the other Party shall take appropriate corrective action. Failure by the other Party to take appropriate action within 15 days or such other period as may be agreed shall be grounds for the requesting Party to refuse, revoke, suspend, impose conditions on or limit the operating authorisations or technical permissions, or to otherwise refuse, revoke, suspend, impose conditions on or limit the operations of the air carriers under the safety oversight of the other Party.

5. Any aircraft operated by, or under a lease arrangement on behalf of, an air carrier or air carriers of one Party may, while within the territory of the other Party, be made the subject of a ramp inspection, provided that this does not lead to unreasonable delay in the operation of the aircraft.

6. The ramp inspection or series of ramp inspections can give rise to:
    (a) serious concerns that an aircraft or the operation of an aircraft does not comply with the minimum standards established at that time pursuant to the Convention; or
    (b) serious concerns that there is a lack of effective maintenance and administration of safety standards established at that time pursuant to the Convention.
In the event that the Party that conducted the ramp inspection or inspections establishes serious concerns as referred to in point (a) or (b), it shall notify the competent authorities of the other Party that are responsible for the safety oversight of the air carrier operating the aircraft of such findings and inform them of the steps considered necessary to conform with those minimum standards. Failure to take appropriate corrective action within 15 days or such other period as may be agreed shall constitute grounds for the first Party to refuse, revoke, suspend, impose conditions on or limit the operating authorisations or technical permissions or to otherwise refuse, revoke, suspend, impose conditions on or limit the operations of the air carrier operating the aircraft.

7. In the event that access for the purpose of undertaking a ramp inspection of an aircraft operated by the air carrier or air carriers of one Party in accordance with paragraph 5 is denied, the other Party shall be free to infer that serious concerns as referred to in paragraph 6 arise and proceed in accordance with paragraph 6.

8. Each Party reserves the right to immediately revoke, suspend or limit the operating authorisations or technical permissions or to otherwise suspend or limit the operations of an air carrier or air carriers of the other Party, if the first Party concludes as a result of a ramp inspection, a series of ramp inspections, a denial of access for ramp inspection, consultation or otherwise, that immediate action is essential to the safety of an air carrier operation. The Party taking such measures shall promptly inform the other Party, providing reasons for its action.

9. Any action by one Party in accordance with paragraphs 4, 6 or 8 shall be discontinued once the basis for the taking of that action ceases to exist.

10. Where measures have been taken by a Party pursuant to paragraphs 4, 6 or 8, in the event of a dispute a Party may have recourse to arbitration in accordance with Article INST.14 [Arbitration procedure], without having prior recourse to consultations in accordance with Article INST.13 [Consultations]. An arbitration tribunal shall treat the issue as a case of urgency for the purpose of Article INST.19 [Urgent Proceedings]. At the request of the complaining Party, the tribunal may, pending its final ruling, order the adoption of interim relief measures, including the modification or suspension of measures taken by either Party under this Article.

##### Article AIRTRN.19: Aviation security
1. The Parties shall provide upon request all necessary assistance to each other to address any threat to the security of civil aviation, including the prevention of acts of unlawful seizure of civil aircraft and other unlawful acts against the safety of such aircraft, of their passengers and crew, airports and air navigation facilities, and any other threat to the security of civil aviation.

2. The Parties shall, in their mutual relations, act in conformity with the aviation security standards established by ICAO. They shall require that operators of the aircraft in their registries and the operators of airports in their territory, act, at least, in conformity with such aviation security standards. Each Party shall, on request, provide the other Party notification of any difference between its laws, regulations and practices and the aviation security standards referred to in this paragraph. Each Party may at any time request consultations, to be held without delay, with the other Party to discuss those differences.

3. Each Party shall ensure that effective measures are taken within its territory to protect civil aviation against acts of unlawful interference, including, but not limited to, screening of passengers and their cabin baggage, screening of hold baggage, screening and security controls for persons other than passengers, including crew, and their items carried, screening and security controls for cargo, mail, in-flight and airport supplies, and access control to airside and security restricted areas. Each Party agrees that the security provisions of the other Party relating to the admission to, operating within, or departure from its territory of aircraft shall be observed.

4. The Parties shall endeavour to cooperate on aviation security matters to the highest extent, to exchange information on threat, vulnerability and risk, subject to the mutual agreement of appropriate arrangements for the secure transfer, use, storage and disposal of classified information, to discuss and share best practices, performance and detection standards of security equipment, compliance monitoring best practices and results, and in any other area that the Parties may identify. In particular, the Parties shall endeavour to develop and maintain cooperation arrangements between technical experts on the development and recognition of aviation security standards with the aim of facilitating such cooperation, reducing administrative duplication and fostering early notice and prior discussion of new security initiatives and requirements.

5. Each Party shall make available to the other Party on request the results of audits carried out by ICAO and the corrective actions taken by the audited state, subject to the mutual agreement of appropriate arrangements for the secure transfer, use, storage and disposal of such information.

6. The Parties agree to cooperate on security inspections undertaken by them in the territory of either Party through the establishment of mechanisms, including administrative arrangements, for the reciprocal exchange of information on results of such security inspections. The Parties agree to consider positively requests to participate, as observers, in security inspections undertaken by the other Party.

7. Subject to paragraph 9, and with full regard and mutual respect for the other Party’s sovereignty, a Party may adopt security measures for entry into its territory. Where possible, that Party shall take into account the security measures already applied by the other Party and any views that the other Party may offer. Each Party recognises that nothing in this Article limits the right of a Party to refuse entry into its territory of any flight or flights that it deems to present a threat to its security.

8. A Party may take emergency measures to meet a specific security threat. Such measures shall be notified immediately to the other Party. Without prejudice to the need to take immediate action in order to protect aviation security, when considering security measures, a Party shall evaluate possible adverse effects on international air transport and, unless constrained by law, shall take such effects into account when it determines what measures are necessary and appropriate to address the security concerns.

9. With regard to air services bound for its territory, a Party may not require security measures to be implemented in the territory of the other Party. Where a Party considers that a specific threat urgently requires the implementation of temporary measures in addition to the measures already in place in the territory of the other Party, it shall inform the other Party of the particulars of that threat to the extent consistent with the need to protect security information, and of the proposed measures. The other Party shall give positive consideration to such a proposal and may decide to implement additional measures as it deems necessary. Such measures shall be proportionate and limited in time.

10. When an incident or threat of an incident of unlawful seizure of civil aircraft or other unlawful acts against the safety of aircraft, passengers, crew, airports or air navigation facilities occurs, the Parties shall assist each other by facilitating communications and other appropriate measures intended to rapidly and safely terminate such incident or threat.

11. Each Party shall take all measures it finds practicable to ensure that an aircraft subjected to an act of unlawful seizure or other acts of unlawful interference which is on the ground in its territory is detained on the ground unless its departure is necessitated by the overriding duty to protect human life. Where practicable, such measures shall be taken on the basis of consultations between the Parties.

12. When a Party has reasonable grounds to believe that the other Party does not comply with this Article, that Party may request immediate consultations with the other Party. Such consultations shall start within 30 days of the receipt of such a request. Failure to reach a satisfactory agreement within 15 days or such other period as may be agreed from the date of such request shall constitute grounds for the Party that requested the consultations to take action to refuse, revoke, suspend, impose conditions on or limit the operating authorisation and technical permissions of an air carrier or air carriers of the other Party to ensure compliance with this Article. When required by an emergency, or to prevent further non-compliance with this Article, a Party may take interim action prior to the expiry of the 15 day-period referred to in this paragraph.

13. Any action taken in accordance with paragraph 8 shall be discontinued when the Party in question considers that the action is no longer required or has been superseded by other measures to mitigate the threat. Any action taken in accordance with paragraph 12 shall be discontinued upon compliance by the other Party with this Article. In the case of action taken in accordance with paragraph 8 or 12, this may be discontinued as mutually agreed by the Parties.

14. Where measures or actions have been taken in accordance with paragraphs 7, 8, 9 or 12, a Party may have recourse to the dispute settlement provisions of Title I [Dispute settlement] of Part Six. An arbitration tribunal shall treat the issue as a case of urgency for the purpose of Article INST.19 [Urgent Proceedings].

If the Parties become party to a multilateral agreement, or endorse a decision adopted by ICAO or another international organisation that addresses matters covered by this Title, they shall consult in the Specialised Committee on Air Transport to determine whether this Title should be revised to take into account such developments.

4. Nothing in this Title shall affect the validity and application of existing and future agreements between the Member States and the United Kingdom as regards territories under their respective sovereignty which are not covered by Article FINPROV.1 [Territorial scope].

5. Nothing in this Title shall affect any rights available to the United Kingdom and Member States under the Multilateral Agreement on Commercial Rights of Non-Scheduled Air Services in Europe, signed at Paris on 30 April 1956, to the extent that such rights go beyond those laid down in this Title.
