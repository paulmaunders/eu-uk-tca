##### ANNEX ENER-4: ALLOCATION OF ELECTRICITY INTERCONNECTOR CAPACITY AT THE DAY-AHEAD

##### MARKET TIMEFRAME

 
Part 1
 
1. The new procedure for the allocation of capacity on electricity interconnectors at the day-ahead

 
market timeframe shall be based on the concept of “Multi-region loose volume coupling”.
 
 
The overall objective of the new procedure shall be to maximise the benefits of trade.
 
 
As the first step in developing the new procedure, the Parties shall ensure that transmission system
operators prepare outline proposals and a cost-benefit analysis.
 
2. Multi-region loose volume coupling shall involve the development of a market coupling function to

 
determine the net energy positions (implicit allocation) between:
 
 
(a) bidding zones established in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2019/943, which are directly
connected to the United Kingdom by an electricity interconnector; and
 
 
(b) the United Kingdom.
 
3. The net energy positions over electricity interconnectors shall be calculated via an implicit allocation

 
process by applying a specific algorithm to:
 
 
(a) commercial bids and offers for the day-ahead market timeframe from the bidding zones
established in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2019/943 which are directly connected to the
United Kingdom by an electricity interconnector;
 
 
(b) commercial bids and offers for the day-ahead market timeframe from relevant day-ahead
markets in the United Kingdom;
 
 
(c) network capacity data and system capabilities determined in accordance with the procedures
agreed between transmission system operators; and
 
 
(d) data on expected commercial flows of electricity interconnections between bidding zones
connected to the United Kingdom and other bidding zones in the Union, as determined by
Union transmission system operators using robust methodologies.
 
 
This process shall be compatible with the specific characteristics of direct current electricity
interconnectors, including losses and ramping requirements.
 
4. The market coupling function shall:

 
(a) produce results sufficiently in advance of the operation of the Parties’ respective day-ahead
markets (for the Union this is single day-ahead coupling established in accordance with
 

 
Commission Regulation (EU) 2015/1222^135 ) in order that such results may be used as inputs
into the processes which determine the results in those markets;
 
 
(b) produce results which are reliable and repeatable;
 
 
(c) be a specific process to link the distinct and separate day-ahead markets in the Union and
the United Kingdom; in particular, this means that the specific algorithm shall be distinct and
separate from that used in single day-ahead coupling established in accordance with
Regulation (EU) 2015/1222 and, in respect of commercial bids and offers of the Union, only
have access to those from bidding zones which are directly connected to the United
Kingdom by an electricity interconnector.
 
5. The calculated net energy positions shall be published following validation and verification. If the

 
market coupling function is unable either to operate or to produce a result, electricity
interconnector capacity shall be allocated by a fall-back process, and market participants shall be
notified that the fall-back process will apply.
 
6. The costs of developing and implementing the technical procedures shall be equally shared between

 
the relevant United Kingdom transmission system operators or other entities, on the one side, and
relevant Union transmission system operators or other entities, on the other side, unless the
Specialised Committee on Energy decides otherwise.
 
 
Part 2
 
 
The timeline for the implementation of this Annex shall be from the entry into force of this
Agreement, as follows:
 
 
(a) within 3 months – cost benefit analysis and outline of proposals for technical procedures;
 
 
(b) within 10 months – proposal for technical procedures;
 
 
(c) within 15 months – entry into operation of technical procedures.
