3. The national contact point shall also be the central point of contact in respect of review, correction and deletion of personal data.

2. The competent authorities shall clearly indicate, at the latest at the moment of transferring personal data, the specific purpose or purposes for which the personal data are being transferred. For transfers to Europol, the purpose or purposes of such transfer shall be specified in line with the specific purposes of processing set out in the Europol Regulation. If the transferring competent authority has not done so, the receiving competent authority, in agreement with the transferring authority, shall process the personal data in order to determine their relevance as well as the purpose or purposes for which it is to be further processed. The competent authorities may process personal data for a purpose other than the purpose for which they have been provided only if authorised to do so by the transferring competent authority.

3. The competent authorities receiving the personal data shall give an undertaking stating that such data will be processed only for the purpose for which they were transferred. The personal data shall be deleted as soon as they are no longer necessary for the purpose for which they were transferred.

4. Europol and the competent authorities of the United Kingdom shall determine without undue delay, and in any event no later than six months after receipt of the personal data, if and to what extent those personal data are necessary for the purpose for which they were transferred and inform the transferring authority accordingly.

##### Article LAW.EUROPOL.52: Restrictions on access to and further use of transferred personal data
1. The transferring competent authority may indicate, at the moment of transferring personal data, any restriction on access thereto or the use to be made thereof, in general or specific terms, including as regards its onward transfer, erasure or destruction after a certain period of time, or its further processing. Where the need for such restrictions becomes apparent after the personal data have been transferred, the transferring competent authority shall inform the receiving competent authority accordingly.

2. The receiving competent authority shall comply with any restriction on access or further use of the personal data indicated by the transferring competent authority as described in paragraph 1.

3. Each Party shall ensure that information transferred under this Title was collected, stored and transferred in accordance with its respective legal framework.

Nor shall such information be transferred if, to the extent reasonably foreseeable, it could be used to request, hand down or execute a death penalty or any form of cruel or inhuman treatment.

##### Article LAW.EUROPOL.53: Different categories of data subjects
1. The transfer of personal data in respect of victims of a criminal offence, witnesses or other persons who can provide information concerning criminal offences, or in respect of persons under the age of 18, shall be prohibited unless such transfer is strictly necessary and proportionate in individual cases for preventing or combating a criminal offence.

##### Article LAW.EUROPOL.54: Facilitation of flow of personal data between the United Kingdom and Europol
In the interest of mutual operational benefits, the Parties shall endeavour to cooperate in the future with a view to ensuring that data exchanges between Europol and the competent authorities of the United Kingdom can take place as quickly as possible, and to consider the incorporation of any new processes and technical developments which might assist with that objective, while taking account of the fact that the United Kingdom is not a Member State.

##### Article LAW.EUROPOL.55: Assessment of reliability of the source and accuracy of information
1. The competent authorities shall indicate as far as possible, at the latest at the moment of transferring the information, the reliability of the source of the information on the basis of the following criteria:
    (a) where there is no doubt as to the authenticity, trustworthiness and competence of the source, or if the information is provided by a source which has proved to be reliable in all instances;
    (b) where the information is provided by a source which has in most instances proved to be reliable;
    (c.) where the information is provided by a source which has in most instances proved to be unreliable;
    (d) where the reliability of the source cannot be assessed.

2. The competent authorities shall indicate as far as possible, at the latest at the moment of transferring the information, the accuracy of the information on the basis of the following criteria:
    (a) information the accuracy of which is not in doubt;
    (b) information known personally to the source but not known personally to the official passing it on;
    (c.) information not known personally to the source but corroborated by other information already recorded;
    (d) information not known personally to the source and which cannot be corroborated.

3. Where the receiving competent authority, on the basis of information already in its possession, comes to the conclusion that the assessment of information or of its source supplied by the transferring competent authority in accordance with paragraphs 1 and 2 needs correction, it shall inform that competent authority and shall attempt to agree on an amendment to the assessment. The receiving competent authority shall not change the assessment of information received or of its source without such agreement.

4. If a competent authority receives information without an assessment, it shall attempt as far as possible and where possible in agreement with the transferring competent authority to assess the reliability of the source or the accuracy of the information on the basis of information already in its possession.

5. If no reliable assessment can be made, the information shall be evaluated as provided for in point (d) of paragraph 1 and point (d) of paragraph 2.

##### Article LAW.EUROPOL.56: Security of the information exchange

##### Article LAW.EUROPOL.57: Liability for unauthorised or incorrect personal data processing
1. The competent authorities shall be liable, in accordance with their respective legal frameworks, for any damage caused to an individual as a result of legal or factual errors in information exchanged. In order to avoid liability under their respective legal frameworks vis-à-vis an injured party, neither Europol nor the competent authorities of the United Kingdom may plead that the other competent authority had transferred inaccurate information.

2. If damages are awarded either against Europol or against the competent authorities of the United Kingdom because of the use by either of them of information which was erroneously communicated by the other, or communicated as a result of a failure on the part of the other to comply with their obligations, the amount paid as compensation under paragraph 1 either by Europol or by the competent authorities of the United Kingdom shall be repaid by the other, unless the information was used in breach of this Title.

3. Europol and the competent authorities of the United Kingdom shall not require each other to pay for punitive or non-compensatory damages under paragraphs 1 and 2.
Article LAW.EUROPOL.58: Exchange of classified and sensitive non-classified information
The exchange and protection of classified and sensitive non-classified information, if necessary under this Title, shall be regulated in working and administrative arrangements as referred to in Article LAW.EUROPOL.59 [Working and administrative arrangements] between Europol and the competent authorities of the United Kingdom.
