powers and procedures provided under the laws, regulations or administrative provisions of that State applying to its claims except where otherwise provided for in this Protocol.

Disputes concerning the claim, the initial instrument permitting enforcement in the State of the applicant authority or the uniform instrument permitting enforcement in the State of the requested authority and disputes concerning the validity of a notification made by an applicant authority shall fall within the competence of the competent bodies of the State of the applicant authority. If, in the course of the recovery procedure, the claim, the initial instrument permitting enforcement in the State of the applicant authority or the uniform instrument permitting enforcement in the State of the requested authority is contested by an interested party, the requested authority shall inform that party that such an action must be brought by the latter before the competent body of the State of the applicant authority in accordance with the laws in force there.

The applicant authority may, in accordance with the laws, regulations and administrative practices in force in its State, ask the requested authority to recover a contested claim or the contested part of a claim, in so far as the laws, regulations and administrative practices in force in the State of the requested authority allow. Any such request shall be reasoned.

Articles 27 [Instruments permitting enforcement in the State of the requested authority and other accompanying documents] and 29 [Disputed claims and enforcement measures] shall apply in relation to the revised instrument.

### Article 31: Request for precautionary measures

### Article 33: Limits to the requested authority’s obligation
1. The requested authority shall not be obliged to grant the assistance provided for in Articles 25 [Request for recovery] to 31 [Request for precautionary measures] if recovery of the claim would, because of the situation of the debtor, create serious economic or social difficulties in the State of the requested authority, in so far as the laws, regulations and administrative practices in force in that State allow such exception for national claims.

2. The requested authority shall not be obliged to grant the assistance provided for in Articles 25 [Request for recovery] to 31 [Request for precautionary measures] where the costs or administrative burdens for the requested State would be clearly disproportionate to the monetary benefit to be derived by the applicant State.

3. The requested authority shall not be obliged to grant the assistance provided for in Article 20 [Request for information] and Articles 22 [Presence in administrative offices and participation in administrative enquiries] to 31 [Request for precautionary measures] if the initial request for assistance pursuant to Article 20 [Request for information], 22 [Presence in administrative offices and participation in administrative enquiries], 23 [Request for notification of certain documents relating to claims], 25 [Request for recovery] or 31 [Request for precautionary measures] is made in respect of claims which are more than 5 years old, dating from the due date of the claim in the State of the applicant authority to the date of the initial request for assistance.

However, in cases where the claim or the initial instrument permitting enforcement in the State of the applicant authority is contested, the 5-year period shall be deemed to begin from the moment when it is established in the State of the applicant authority that the claim or the instrument permitting enforcement may no longer be contested.

Moreover, in cases where a postponement of the payment or payment by instalments arrangement has been granted by the State of the applicant authority, the 5-year period shall be deemed to begin from the moment when the entire extended payment period has come to its end.

However, in those cases the requested authority shall not be obliged to grant assistance in respect of claims which are more than 10 years old, dating from the due date of the claim in the State of the applicant authority.

### Article 34: Questions on limitation
1. Questions concerning periods of limitation shall be governed solely by the laws in force in the State of the applicant authority.

If suspension, interruption or prolongation of the period of limitation is not possible under the laws in force in the State of the requested authority, any steps taken in the recovery of claims by or on behalf of the requested authority in pursuance of a request for assistance which, if they had been carried out by or on behalf of the applicant authority in its own State, would have had the effect of suspending, interrupting or prolonging the period of limitation according to the laws of that State shall be deemed to have been taken in the latter State, in so far as that effect is concerned.

The first and second subparagraphs shall not affect the right of the State of the applicant authority to take measures which have the effect of suspending, interrupting or prolonging the period of limitation in accordance with the laws in force in that State.

3. The applicant authority and the requested authority shall inform each other of any action which interrupts, suspends or prolongs the limitation period of the claim for which the recovery or precautionary measures were requested, or which may have this effect.

### Article 35: Costs
1. In addition to the amounts referred to in paragraph 5 of Article 28 [Execution of the request for recovery], the requested authority shall seek to recover from the person concerned and retain the costs linked to the recovery that it incurred, in accordance with the laws and regulations of its State.2. The States shall renounce all claims on each other for the reimbursement of costs arising from any mutual assistance they grant each other pursuant to this Protocol.

2. However, where recovery creates a specific problem, concerns a very large amount in costs or relates to organised crime, the applicant and requested authorities may agree reimbursement arrangements specific to the cases in question.

3. Notwithstanding paragraph 2, the State of the applicant authority shall be liable to the State of the requested authority for any costs and any losses incurred as a result of actions held to be unfounded, as far as either the substance of the claim or the validity of the instrument permitting enforcement and/or 
precautionary measures issued by the applicant authority are concerned.

1. All requests for assistance, standard forms for notification and uniform instruments permitting enforcement in the State of the requested authority shall be sent in, or shall be accompanied by a translation into, the official language, or one of the official languages, of the State of the requested authority. The fact that certain parts thereof are written in a language other than the official language, or one of the official languages, of that State, shall not affect their validity or the validity of the procedure, in so far as that other language is one agreed between the States concerned.

2. The documents for which notification is requested pursuant to Article 23 [Request for notification of certain documents relating to claims] may be sent to the requested authority in an official language of the State of the applicant authority.
