## TITLE XI: FREEZING AND CONFISCATION

##### Article LAW.CONFISC.1: Objective and principles of cooperation
1. The objective of this Title is to provide for cooperation between the United Kingdom, on the one side, and the Member States, on the other side, to the widest extent possible for the purposes of investigations and proceedings aimed at the freezing of property with a view to subsequent confiscation thereof and investigations and proceedings aimed at the confiscation of property within the framework of proceedings in criminal matters. This does not preclude other cooperation pursuant to Article LAW.CONFISC.10(5) and (6) [Obligation to confiscate]. This Title also provides for cooperation with Union bodies designated by the Union for the purposes of this Title.

2. Each State shall comply, under the conditions provided for in this Title, with requests from another State:
    (a) for the confiscation of specific items of property, as well as for the confiscation of proceeds consisting in a requirement to pay a sum of money corresponding to the value of proceeds;
    (b) for investigative assistance and provisional measures with a view to either form of confiscation referred to in point (a).

3. Investigative assistance and provisional measures sought under point (b) of paragraph 2 shall be carried out as permitted by and in accordance with the domestic law of the requested State. Where the request concerning one of these measures specifies formalities or procedures which are necessary under the domestic law of the requesting State, even if unfamiliar to the requested State, the latter shall comply with such requests to the extent that the action sought is not contrary to the fundamental principles of its domestic law.

4. The requested State shall ensure that the requests coming from another State to identify, trace, freeze or seize the proceeds and instrumentalities, receive the same priority as those made in the framework of domestic procedures.

5. When requesting confiscation, investigative assistance and provisional measures for the purposes of confiscation, the requesting State shall ensure that the principles of necessity and proportionality are respected.

6. The provisions of this Title apply in place of the “international cooperation” Chapters of the Council of Europe Convention on Laundering, Search, Seizure and Confiscation of the Proceeds from Crime and on the Financing of Terrorism, done at Warsaw on 16 May 2005 (“the 2005 Convention”) and the Convention on Laundering, Search, Seizure and Confiscation of the Proceeds from Crime, done at Strasbourg on 8 November 1990 (“the 1990 Convention”). Article LAW.CONFISC.2 [Definitions] of this Agreement replaces the corresponding definitions in Article 1 of the 2005 Convention and Article 1 of the 1990 Convention. The provisions of this Title do not affect the States’ obligations under the other provisions of the 2005 Convention and the 1990 Convention.

##### Article LAW.CONFISC.2: Definitions
For the purposes of this Title, the following definitions apply:
    (a) “confiscation” means a penalty or a measure ordered by a court following proceedings in relation to a criminal offence or criminal offences, resulting in the final deprivation of property;
    (b) “freezing” or “seizure” means temporarily prohibiting the transfer, destruction, conversion, disposition or movement of property or temporarily assuming custody or control of property on the basis of an order issued by a court or other competent authority;

    (e) “proceeds” means any economic benefit, derived from or obtained, directly or indirectly, from criminal offences, or an amount of money equivalent to that economic benefit; it may consist of any property as defined in this Article;
    (f) “property” includes property of any description, whether corporeal or incorporeal, movable or immovable, and legal documents or instruments evidencing title or interest in such property, which the requesting State considers to be:
        (i) the proceeds of a criminal offence, or its equivalent, whether the full amount of the value of such proceeds or only part of the value of such proceeds;
        (ii) the instrumentalities of a criminal offence, or the value of such instrumentalities;

##### Article LAW.CONFISC.7: Spontaneous information
Without prejudice to its own investigations or proceedings, a State may without prior request forward to another State information on instrumentalities, proceeds and other property liable to confiscation, where it considers that the disclosure of such information might assist the receiving State in initiating or carrying out investigations or proceedings or might lead to a request by that State under this Title.

##### Article LAW.CONFISC.8: Obligation to take provisional measures
1. At the request of another State which has instituted a criminal investigation or proceedings, or an investigation or proceedings for the purposes of confiscation, the requested State shall take the necessary provisional measures, such as freezing or seizing, to prevent any dealing in, transfer or disposal of property which, at a later stage, may be the subject of a request for confiscation or which might satisfy the request.

2. A State which has received a request for confiscation pursuant to Article LAW.CONFISC.10 [Obligation to confiscate] shall, if so requested, take the measures referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article in respect of any property which is the subject of the request or which might satisfy the request.

4. Where the requesting State states that immediate freezing is necessary since there are legitimate grounds to believe that the property in question will immediately be removed or destroyed, the requested State shall take all necessary measures to comply with the request within 96 hours of receiving the request and send confirmation to the requesting State by any means of producing a written record and without delay.

5. Where the requested State is unable to comply with the time limits under paragraph 4, the requested State shall immediately inform the requesting State, and consult with the requesting State on the appropriate next steps.

6. Any expiration of the time limits under paragraph 4 does not extinguish the requirements placed on the requested State by this Article.

1. After the execution of the provisional measures requested in conformity with Article LAW.CONFISC.8(1) [Obligation to take provisional measures], the requesting State shall provide spontaneously and as soon as possible to the requested State all information which may question or modify the extent of those measures. The requesting State shall also provide without delay all complementary information required by the requested State and which is necessary for the implementation of and the follow-up to the provisional measures.

2. Before lifting any provisional measure taken pursuant to Article LAW.CONFISC.8 [Obligation to take provisional measures], the requested State shall, wherever possible, give the requesting State an opportunity to present its reasons in favour of continuing the measure.

    (a) enforce a confiscation order made by a court of the requesting State in relation to such property; or
    (b) submit the request to its competent authorities for the purpose of obtaining an order of confiscation and, if such an order is granted, enforce it.

2. For the purposes of point (b) of paragraph 1, the States shall, whenever necessary, have competence to institute confiscation proceedings under their own domestic law.

3. Paragraph 1 also applies to confiscation consisting in a requirement to pay a sum of money corresponding to the value of proceeds, if property against which the confiscation can be enforced is located in the requested State. In such cases, when enforcing confiscation pursuant to paragraph 1,the requested State shall, if payment is not obtained, realise the claim on any property available for that purpose.

4. If a request for confiscation concerns a specific item of property, the requesting State and requested State may agree that the requested State may enforce the confiscation in the form of a requirement to pay a sum of money corresponding to the value of the property.

5. A State shall cooperate to the widest extent possible under its domestic law with a State requesting the execution of measures equivalent to confiscation of property, where the request has not been issued in the framework of proceedings in criminal matters, in so far as such measures are ordered by a judicial authority of the requesting State in relation to a criminal offence, provided that it has been established that the property constitutes proceeds or:
    (a) other property into which the proceeds have been transformed or converted;
    (b) property acquired from legitimate sources, if proceeds have been intermingled, in whole or in part, with such property, up to the assessed value of the intermingled proceeds; or
    (c.) income or other benefit derived from the proceeds, from property into which proceeds of crime have been transformed or converted or from property with which the proceeds of crime have been intermingled, up to the assessed value of the intermingled proceeds, in the same manner and to the same extent as proceeds.

6. The measures referred to in paragraph 5 include measures which allow the seizure, detention and forfeiture of property and assets by means of applications to civil courts.

7. The requested State shall take the decision on the execution of the confiscation order without delay, and, without prejudice to paragraph 8 of this Article, no later than 45 days after receiving the request. The requested State shall send confirmation to the requesting State by any means of producing a written record and without delay.

8. Where the requested State is unable to comply with the time limit under paragraph 7, the requested State shall immediately inform the requesting State, and consult with the requesting State on the appropriate next steps.

9. Any expiration of the time limit under paragraph 7 does not extinguish the requirements placed on the requested State by this Article.

2. When acting on the request made by another State pursuant to Article LAW.CONFISC.10 [Obligation to confiscate], the requested State shall, to the extent permitted by its domestic law and if so requested, give priority consideration to returning the confiscated property to the requesting State so that it can give compensation to the victims of the crime or return such property to their legitimate owners.

3. Where acting on the request made by another State in accordance with Article LAW.CONFISC.10 [Obligation to confiscate], and after having taken into account the right of a victim to restitution or compensation of property pursuant to paragraph 2 of this Article, the requested State shall dispose of the money obtained as a result of the execution of a confiscation order as follows:
    (a) if the amount is equal to or less than EUR 10 000, the amount shall accrue to the requested State; or
    (b) if the amount is greater than EUR 10 000, the requested State shall transfer 50 % of the amount recovered to the requesting State.

4. Notwithstanding paragraph 3, the requesting State and requested State may, on a case-by-case basis, give special consideration to concluding other such agreements or arrangements on disposal of property as they deem appropriate.

##### Article LAW.CONFISC.13: Right of enforcement and maximum amount of confiscation
1. A request for confiscation made under Article LAW.CONFISC.10 [Obligation to confiscate] does not affect the right of the requesting State to enforce the confiscation order itself.

2. Nothing in this Title shall be interpreted as permitting the total value of the confiscation to exceed the amount of the sum of money specified in the confiscation order. If a State finds that this might occur, the States concerned shall enter into consultations to avoid such an effect.

##### Article LAW.CONFISC.14: Imprisonment in default
The requested State shall not impose imprisonment in default or any other measure restricting the liberty of a person as a result of a request under Article LAW.CONFISC.10 [Obligation to confiscate] without the consent of the requesting State.

##### Article LAW.CONFISC.15: Grounds for refusal
1. Cooperation under this Title may be refused if:
    (a) the requested State considers that executing the request would be contrary to the principle of ne bis in idem; or
    (b) the offence to which the request relates does not constitute an offence under the domestic law of the requested State if committed within its jurisdiction; however, this ground for refusal applies to cooperation under Articles LAW.CONFISC.3 [Obligation to assist] to LAW.CONFISC.7 [Spontaneous information] only in so far as the assistance sought involves coercive action.

2. The United Kingdom and the Union, acting on behalf of any of its Member States, may each notify the Specialised Committee on Law Enforcement and Judicial Cooperation that, on the basis of reciprocity, the condition of double criminality referred to in point (b) of paragraph 1 of this Article will not be applied provided that the offence giving rise to the request is:
    (a) one of the offences listed in Article LAW.SURR.79(4) [Scope], as defined by the law of the requesting State; and
    (b) punishable by the requesting State by a custodial sentence or a detention order for a maximum period of at least three years.

3. Cooperation under Articles LAW.CONFISC.3 [Obligation to assist] to LAW.CONFISC.7 [Spontaneous information], in so far as the assistance sought involves coercive action, and under Articles LAW.CONFISC.8 [Obligation to take provisional measures] and LAW.CONFISC.9 [Execution of provisional measures] may also be refused if the measures sought could not be taken under the domestic law of the requested State for the purposes of investigations or proceedings in a similar domestic case.

4. Where the domestic law of the requested State so requires, cooperation under Articles LAW.CONFISC.3 [Obligation to assist] to LAW.CONFISC.7 [Spontaneous information], in so far as the assistance sought involves coercive action, and under Articles LAW.CONFISC.8 [Obligation to take provisional measures] and LAW.CONFISC.9 [Execution of provisional measures] may also be refused if the measures sought or any other measures having similar effects would not be permitted under the domestic law of the requesting State, or, as regards the competent authorities of the requesting State, if the request is not authorised by a judicial authority acting in relation to criminal offences.

5. Cooperation under Articles LAW.CONFISC.10 [Obligation to confiscate] to LAW.CONFISC.14 [Imprisonment in default] may also be refused if:
    (a) under the domestic law of the requested State, confiscation is not provided for in respect of the type of offence to which the request relates;
    (b) without prejudice to the obligation pursuant to Article LAW.CONFISC.10(3) [Obligation to confiscate], it would be contrary to the principles of the domestic law of the requested State concerning the limits of confiscation in respect of the relationship between an offence and:
        (i) an economic advantage that might be qualified as its proceeds; or
        (ii) property that might be qualified as its instrumentalities;
    (c.) under the domestic law of the requested State, confiscation may no longer be imposed or enforced because of the lapse of time;
    (d) without prejudice to Article LAW.CONFISC.10 (5) and (6) [Obligation to confiscate], the request does not relate to a previous conviction, or a decision of a judicial nature or a statement in such a decision that an offence or several offences have been committed, on the basis of which the confiscation has been ordered or is sought;
    (e) confiscation is either not enforceable in the requesting State, or it is still subject to ordinary means of appeal; or
    (f) the request relates to a confiscation order resulting from a decision rendered in absentia of the person against whom the order was issued and, in the opinion of the requested State, the proceedings conducted by the requesting State leading to such decision did not satisfy the minimum rights of defence recognised as due to everyone against whom a criminal charge is made.

6. For the purposes of point (f) of paragraph 5 a decision is not considered to have been rendered in absentia if:
    (a) it has been confirmed or pronounced after opposition by the person concerned; or
    (b) it has been rendered on appeal, provided that the appeal was lodged by the person concerned.

7. When considering, for the purposes of point (f) of paragraph 5, whether the minimum rights of defence have been satisfied, the requested State shall take into account the fact that the person concerned has deliberately sought to evade justice or the fact that that person, having had the possibility of lodging a legal remedy against the decision made in absentia, elected not to do so. The same applies where the person concerned, having been duly served with the summons to appear, elected not to do so nor to ask for adjournment.

8. The States shall not invoke bank secrecy as a ground to refuse any cooperation under this Title. Where its domestic law so requires, a requested State may require that a request for cooperation which would involve the lifting of bank secrecy be authorised by a judicial authority acting in relation to criminal offences.

9. The requested State shall not invoke the fact that:
    (a) the person under investigation or subject to a confiscation order by the authorities of the requesting State is a legal person as an obstacle to affording any cooperation under this Title;
    (b) the natural person against whom an order of confiscation of proceeds has been issued has died or a legal person against whom an order of confiscation of proceeds has been issued has subsequently been dissolved as an obstacle to affording assistance in accordance with point (a) of Article LAW.CONFISC.10(1) [Obligation to confiscate]; or
    (c.) the person under investigation or subject to a confiscation order by the authorities of the requesting State is mentioned in the request both as the author of the underlying criminal offence and of the offence of money laundering as an obstacle to affording any cooperation under this Title.

##### Article LAW.CONFISC.16: Consultation and information
Where there are substantial grounds for believing that the execution of a freezing or confiscation order would entail a real risk for the protection of fundamental rights, the requested State shall, before it decides on the execution of the freezing or confiscation order, consult the requesting State and may require any necessary information to be provided.

##### Article LAW.CONFISC.17: Postponement
The requested State may postpone action on a request if such action would prejudice investigations or proceedings by its authorities.

##### Article LAW.CONFISC.18: Partial or conditional granting of a request
Before refusing or postponing cooperation under this Title, the requested State shall, where appropriate after having consulted the requesting State, consider whether the request may be granted partially or subject to such conditions as it deems necessary.

##### Article LAW.CONFISC.19: Notification of documents
1. The States shall afford each other the widest measure of mutual assistance in the serving of judicial documents to persons affected by provisional measures and confiscation.

2. Nothing in this Article is intended to interfere with:
    (a) the possibility of sending judicial documents, by postal channels, directly to persons abroad; and
    (b) the possibility for judicial officers, officials or other competent authorities of the State of origin to effect service of judicial documents directly through the consular authorities of that State or through the judicial authorities, including judicial officers and officials, or other competent authorities of the State of destination.

3. When serving judicial documents to persons abroad affected by provisional measures or confiscation orders issued in the sending State, that State shall indicate what legal remedies are available under its domestic law to such persons.

##### Article LAW.CONFISC.20: Recognition of foreign decisions
1. When dealing with a request for cooperation under Articles LAW.CONFISC.8 [Obligation to take provisional measures] to LAW.CONFISC.14 [Imprisonment in default] the requested State shall recognise any decision issued by a judicial authority taken in the requesting State regarding rights claimed by third parties.

2. Recognition may be refused if:
    (a) third parties did not have adequate opportunity to assert their rights;
    (b) the decision is incompatible with a decision already taken in the requested State on the same matter;
    (c.) it is incompatible with the ordre public of the requested State; or
