Where PNR data retained in accordance with Article LAW.PNR.28 [Retention of PNR data] has been used subject to the conditions set out in Article LAW.PNR.29 [Conditions for the use of PNR data] or has been disclosed in accordance with Article LAW.PNR.31 [Disclosure within the United Kingdom] or Article LAW.PNR.32 [Disclosure outside the United Kingdom], the United Kingdom shall notify the passengers concerned in writing, individually and within a reasonable time once such notification is no longer liable to jeopardise the investigations by the public authorities concerned to the extent that the relevant contact information of the passengers is available or can be retrieved, taking into account reasonable efforts. The notification shall include information on how the natural person concerned can seek administrative or judicial redress.

##### Article LAW.PNR.27: Automated processing of PNR data
1. The United Kingdom competent authority shall ensure that any automated processing of PNR data is based on non-discriminatory, specific and reliable pre-established models and criteria to enable it to:
    (a) arrive at results targeting natural persons who might be under a reasonable suspicion of involvement or participation in terrorism or serious crime; or
    (b) in exceptional circumstances, protect the vital interests of any natural person as set out in Article LAW.PNR.20(2) [Purposes of the use of PNR data].

##### Article LAW.PNR.28: Retention of PNR data
1. The United Kingdom shall not retain PNR data for more than five years from the date that it receives the PNR data.

2. No later than six months after the transfer of the PNR data referred to in paragraph 1, all PNR data shall be depersonalised by masking out the following data elements which could serve to identify directly the passenger to whom the PNR data relate or any other natural person:
    (a) names, including the names of other passengers on the PNR and number of passengers on the PNR travelling together;
    (b) addresses, telephone numbers and electronic contact information of the passenger, the persons who made the flight reservation for the passenger, persons through whom the air passenger may be contacted and persons who are to be informed in the event of an emergency;
    (c.) all available payment and billing information, to the extent that it contains any information which could serve to identify a natural person;

8. Notwithstanding paragraphs 1, 2 and 4, the United Kingdom may retain PNR data required for any specific action, review, investigation, enforcement action, judicial proceeding, prosecution, or enforcement of penalties, until concluded.

9. The United Kingdom shall delete the PNR data at the end of the PNR data retention period.

10. Paragraph 11 applies due to the special circumstances that prevent the United Kingdom from making the technical adjustments necessary to transform the PNR processing systems which the United Kingdom operated whilst Union law applied to it into systems which would enable PNR data to be deleted in accordance with paragraph 4.

11. The United Kingdom may derogate from paragraph 4 on a temporary basis for an interim period, the duration of which is provided for in paragraph 13, pending the implementation by the United Kingdom of technical adjustments as soon as possible. During the interim period, the United Kingdom competent authority shall prevent the use of the PNR data that is to be deleted in accordance with paragraph 4 by applying the following additional safeguards to that PNR data:
    (a) the PNR data shall be accessible only to a limited number of authorised officials and only where necessary to determine whether the PNR data should be deleted in accordance with paragraph 4;
    (b) the request to use the PNR data shall be refused in cases where the data is to be deleted in accordance with paragraph 4, and no further access shall be granted to that data where the documentation referred to in point (d) of this paragraph indicates that an earlier request for use has been refused;
    (c.) deletion of the PNR data shall be ensured as soon as possible using best efforts, taking into account the special circumstances referred to in paragraph 10; and
    (d) the following shall be documented in accordance with Article LAW.PNR.30 [Logging and documenting of PNR data processing], and such documentation shall be made available to the independent administrative body referred to in paragraph 7 of this Article:
        (i) any requests to use the PNR data;
        (ii) the date and time of the access to the PNR data for the purpose of assessing whether deletion of the PNR data was required;
        (iii) that the request to use the PNR data was refused on the basis that the PNR data should have been deleted under paragraph 4, including the date and time of the refusal; and
        (iv) the date and time of the deletion of the PNR data in accordance with point (c) of this paragraph.

12. The United Kingdom shall provide to the Specialised Committee on Law Enforcement and Judicial Cooperation, nine months after the entry into force of this Agreement and again a year later if the interim period is extended for a further year:
    (a) a report from the independent administrative body referred to in paragraph 7 of this Article, which shall include the opinion of the United Kingdom supervisory authority referred to in Article LAW.GEN.4(3) [Protection of personal data] as to whether the safeguards provided for in paragraph 11 of this Article have been effectively applied; and

    (b) the assessment of the United Kingdom of whether the special circumstances referred to in paragraph 10 of this Article persist, together with a description of the efforts made to transform the PNR processing systems of the United Kingdom into systems which would enable PNR data to be deleted in accordance with paragraph 4 of this Article.

13. The Specialised Committee on Law Enforcement and Judicial Cooperation shall meet within one year of the entry into force of this Agreement to consider the report and assessment provided under paragraph 12. Where the special circumstances referred to in paragraph 10 persist, the Partnership Council shall extend the interim period referred to in paragraph 11 for one year. The Partnership Council shall extend the interim period for one further final year, under the same conditions and following the same procedure as for the first extension where, in addition, substantial progress has been made, although it has not yet been possible to transform the United Kingdom PNR processing systems into systems which would enable PNR data to be deleted in accordance with paragraph 4.

14. If the United Kingdom considers that a refusal by the Partnership Council to grant either of those extensions was not justified, it may suspend this Title with one month’s notice.

15. On the third anniversary of the date of entry into force of this Agreement, paragraphs 10 to 14 shall cease to apply.

##### Article LAW.PNR.29: Conditions for the use of PNR data

    (b) if the executing judicial authority is informed that the requested person has been finally judged by a State in respect of the same acts, provided that, if a penalty has been imposed, it has been enforced, is in the process of being enforced or can no longer be enforced under the law of the sentencing State; or
    (c.) if the person who is the subject of the arrest warrant may not, owing to the person’s age, be held criminally responsible for the acts on which the arrest warrant is based under the law of the executing State.

##### Article LAW.SURR.81: Other grounds for non-execution of the arrest warrant
1. The execution of the arrest warrant may be refused:
    (a) if, in one of the cases referred to in Article LAW.SURR.79(2) [Scope], the act on which the arrest warrant is based does not constitute an offence under the law of the executing State; however, in relation to taxes or duties, customs and exchange, the execution of the arrest warrant shall not be refused on the grounds that the law of the executing State does not impose the same kind of tax or duty or does not contain the same type of rules as regards taxes or duties, customs and exchange regulations as the law of the issuing State;
    (b) if the person who is the subject of the arrest warrant is being prosecuted in the executing State for the same act as that on which the arrest warrant is based;
    (c.) if the judicial authorities of the executing State have decided either not to prosecute for the offence on which the arrest warrant is based or to halt proceedings, or if a final judgment which prevents further proceedings has been passed upon the requested person in a State in respect of the same acts;
    (d) if the criminal prosecution or punishment of the requested person is statute-barred under the law of the executing State and the acts fall within the jurisdiction of that State under its own criminal law;
    (e) if the executing judicial authority is informed that the requested person has been finally judged by a third country in respect of the same acts provided that, if a penalty has been imposed, it has been enforced, is in the process of being enforced or can no longer be enforced under the law of the sentencing country;
    (f) if the arrest warrant has been issued for the purposes of execution of a custodial sentence or detention order and the requested person is staying in, or is a national or a resident of the executing State and that State undertakes to execute the sentence or detention order in accordance with its domestic law; if consent of the requested person to the transfer of the sentence or detention order to the executing State is required, the executing State may refuse to execute the arrest warrant only after the requested person consents to the transfer of the sentence or detention order;
    (g) if the arrest warrant relates to offences which:
        (i) are regarded by the law of the executing State as having been committed in whole or in part in the territory of the executing State or in a place treated as such or
        (ii) have been committed outside the territory of the issuing State, and the law of the executing State does not allow prosecution for the same offences if committed outside its territory;
    (h) if there are reasons to believe on the basis of objective elements that the arrest warrant has been issued for the purpose of prosecuting or punishing a person on the grounds the person’s sex, race, religion, ethnic origin, nationality, language, political opinions or sexual orientation, or that that person’s position may be prejudiced for any of those reasons;
    (i) if the arrest warrant has been issued for the purpose of executing a custodial sentence or a detention order and the requested person did not appear in person at the trial resulting in the decision, unless the arrest warrant states that the person, in accordance with further procedural requirements defined in the domestic law of the issuing State:
        (i) in due time:
            (A) either was summoned in person and thereby informed of the scheduled date and place of the trial which resulted in the decision, or by other means actually received official information of the scheduled date and place of that trial in such a manner that it was unequivocally established that the person was aware of the date and place of the scheduled trial;
            and
            (B) was informed that a decision may be handed down if that person did not appear for the trial;
        or
        (ii) being aware of the date and place of the scheduled trial, had given a mandate to a lawyer, who was either appointed by the person concerned or by the State, to defend him or her at the trial, and was indeed defended by that lawyer at the trial;
        or
        (iii) after being served with the decision and being expressly informed about the right to a retrial or appeal in which the person has the right to participate and which allows the merits of the case, including fresh evidence, to be re-examined, and which may lead to the original decision being reversed:
            (A) expressly stated that the person did not contest the decision;
            or
            (B) did not request a retrial or appeal within the applicable time frame;
            or
            (iv) was not personally served with the decision but:
                (A) will be personally served with it without delay after the surrender and will be expressly informed of the right to a retrial or appeal in which the person has the right to participate and which allows the merits of the case, including fresh evidence, to be re-examined, and which may lead to the original decision being reversed;
                and
                (B) will be informed of the time frame within which the person has to request such a retrial or appeal, as mentioned in the relevant arrest warrant.

2. Where the arrest warrant is issued for the purpose of executing a custodial sentence or detention order under the conditions in point (i) (iv) of paragraph 1 and the person concerned has not previously received any official information about the existence of the criminal proceedings against him or her, that person may, when being informed about the content of the arrest warrant, request to receive a copy of the judgment before being surrendered. Immediately after having been informed about the request, the issuing authority shall provide the copy of the judgment via the executing authority to the person concerned. The request of the person concerned shall neither delay the surrender procedure nor delay the decision to execute the arrest warrant. The provision of the judgment to the person concerned shall be for information purposes only; it shall not be regarded as a formal service of the judgment nor actuate any time limits applicable for requesting a retrial or appeal.

3. Where a person is surrendered under the conditions in point (i) (iv) of paragraph 1 and that person has requested a retrial or appeal, until those proceedings are finalised the detention of that person awaiting such retrial or appeal shall be reviewed in accordance with the domestic law of the issuing State, either on a regular basis or upon request of the person concerned.

    (b) offences of conspiracy or association to commit one or more of the offences referred to in Articles 1 and 2 of the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism, if those offences of conspiracy or association correspond to the description of behaviour referred to in Article LAW.SURR.79(3) [Scope] of this Agreement; and
    (c.) terrorism as defined in ANNEX LAW-7 to this Agreement.

The notification shall be based on reasons related to the fundamental principles or practice of the domestic legal order of the United Kingdom or the State on behalf of which a notification was made. In such a case, the Union, on behalf of any of its Member States or the United Kingdom, as the case may be, may notify the Specialised Committee on Law Enforcement and Judicial Cooperation within a reasonable time after the receipt of the other Party’s notification that the executing judicial authorities of the Member State or the United Kingdom, as the case may be, may refuse to surrender its nationals to that State or that surrender shall be authorised only under certain specified conditions.

3. In circumstances where a State has refused to execute an arrest warrant on the basis that, in the case of the United Kingdom, it has made a notification or, in the case of a Member State, the Union has made a notification on its behalf, as referred to in paragraph 2, that State shall consider instituting proceedings against its own national which are commensurate with the subject matter of the arrest warrant, having taken into account the views of the issuing State. In circumstances where a judicial authority decides not to institute such proceedings, the victim of the offence on which the arrest warrant is based shall be able to receive information on the decision in accordance with the applicable domestic law.

4. Where a State’s competent authorities institute proceedings against its own national in accordance with paragraph 3, that State shall ensure that its competent authorities are able to take appropriate measures to assist the victims and witnesses in circumstances where they are residents of another State, particularly with regard to the way in which the proceedings are conducted.

##### Article LAW.SURR.84: Guarantees to be given by the issuing State in particular cases
The execution of the arrest warrant by the executing judicial authority may be subject to the following guarantees:
    (a) if the offence on which the arrest warrant is based is punishable by a custodial life sentence or a lifetime detention order in the issuing State, the executing State may make the execution of the arrest warrant subject to the condition that the issuing State gives a guarantee deemed sufficient by the executing State that the issuing State will review the penalty or measure imposed, on request or at the latest after 20 years, or will encourage the application of measures of clemency for which the person is entitled to apply under the law or practice of the issuing State, aiming at the non-execution of such penalty or measure;
    (b) if a person who is the subject of an arrest warrant for the purposes of prosecution is a national or resident of the executing State, the surrender of that person may be subject to the condition that the person, after being heard, is returned to the executing State in order to serve there the custodial sentence or detention order passed against him or her in the issuing State; if the consent of the requested person to the transfer of the sentence or detention order to the executing State is required, the guarantee that the person be returned to the executing State to serve the person’s sentence is subject to the condition that the requested person, after being heard, consents to be returned to the executing State;
    (c.) if there are substantial grounds for believing that there is a real risk to the protection of the fundamental rights of the requested person, the executing judicial authority may require, as appropriate, additional guarantees as to the treatment of the requested person after the person’s surrender before it decides whether to execute the arrest warrant.

##### Article LAW.SURR.85: Recourse to the central authority
1.

4. If a request for confiscation concerns a specific item of property, the requesting State and requested State may agree that the requested State may enforce the confiscation in the form of a requirement to pay a sum of money corresponding to the value of the property.

5. A State shall cooperate to the widest extent possible under its domestic law with a State requesting the execution of measures equivalent to confiscation of property, where the request has not been issued in the framework of proceedings in criminal matters, in so far as such measures are ordered by a judicial authority of the requesting State in relation to a criminal offence, provided that it has been established that the property constitutes proceeds or:
    (a) other property into which the proceeds have been transformed or converted;
    (b) property acquired from legitimate sources, if proceeds have been intermingled, in whole or in part, with such property, up to the assessed value of the intermingled proceeds; or
    (c.) income or other benefit derived from the proceeds, from property into which proceeds of crime have been transformed or converted or from property with which the proceeds of crime have been intermingled, up to the assessed value of the intermingled proceeds, in the same manner and to the same extent as proceeds.

6. The measures referred to in paragraph 5 include measures which allow the seizure, detention and forfeiture of property and assets by means of applications to civil courts.

7. The requested State shall take the decision on the execution of the confiscation order without delay, and, without prejudice to paragraph 8 of this Article, no later than 45 days after receiving the request. The requested State shall send confirmation to the requesting State by any means of producing a written record and without delay. Unless grounds for postponement under Article LAW.CONFISC.17 [Postponement] exist, the requested State shall take the concrete measures necessary to execute the confiscation order without delay and, at least, with the same speed and priority as for a similar domestic case.

8. Where the requested State is unable to comply with the time limit under paragraph 7, the requested State shall immediately inform the requesting State, and consult with the requesting State on the appropriate next steps.

9. Any expiration of the time limit under paragraph 7 does not extinguish the requirements placed on the requested State by this Article.

2. When acting on the request made by another State pursuant to Article LAW.CONFISC.10 [Obligation to confiscate], the requested State shall, to the extent permitted by its domestic law and if so requested, give priority consideration to returning the confiscated property to the requesting State so that it can give compensation to the victims of the crime or return such property to their legitimate owners.

3. Where acting on the request made by another State in accordance with Article LAW.CONFISC.10 [Obligation to confiscate], and after having taken into account the right of a victim to restitution or compensation of property pursuant to paragraph 2 of this Article, the requested State shall dispose of the money obtained as a result of the execution of a confiscation order as follows:
    (a) if the amount is equal to or less than EUR 10 000, the amount shall accrue to the requested State; or
    (b) if the amount is greater than EUR 10 000, the requested State shall transfer 50 % of the amount recovered to the requesting State.

##### Article LAW.CONFISC.13: Right of enforcement and maximum amount of confiscation
1. A request for confiscation made under Article LAW.CONFISC.10 [Obligation to confiscate] does not affect the right of the requesting State to enforce the confiscation order itself.

2. Nothing in this Title shall be interpreted as permitting the total value of the confiscation to exceed the amount of the sum of money specified in the confiscation order. If a State finds that this might occur, the States concerned shall enter into consultations to avoid such an effect.

1. Cooperation under this Title may be refused if:
    (a) the requested State considers that executing the request would be contrary to the principle of ne bis in idem; or
    (b) the offence to which the request relates does not constitute an offence under the domestic law of the requested State if committed within its jurisdiction; however, this ground for refusal applies to cooperation under Articles LAW.CONFISC.3 [Obligation to assist] to LAW.CONFISC.7 [Spontaneous information] only in so far as the assistance sought involves coercive action.

2. The United Kingdom and the Union, acting on behalf of any of its Member States, may each notify the Specialised Committee on Law Enforcement and Judicial Cooperation that, on the basis of reciprocity, the condition of double criminality referred to in point (b) of paragraph 1 of this Article will not be applied provided that the offence giving rise to the request is:
    (a) one of the offences listed in Article LAW.SURR.79(4) [Scope], as defined by the law of the requesting State; and
    (b) punishable by the requesting State by a custodial sentence or a detention order for a maximum period of at least three years.

3. Cooperation under Articles LAW.CONFISC.3 [Obligation to assist] to LAW.CONFISC.7 [Spontaneous information], in so far as the assistance sought involves coercive action, and under Articles LAW.CONFISC.8 [Obligation to take provisional measures] and LAW.CONFISC.9 [Execution of provisional measures] may also be refused if the measures sought could not be taken under the domestic law of the requested State for the purposes of investigations or proceedings in a similar domestic case.

4. Where the domestic law of the requested State so requires, cooperation under Articles LAW.CONFISC.3 [Obligation to assist] to LAW.CONFISC.7 [Spontaneous information], in so far as the assistance sought involves coercive action, and under Articles LAW.CONFISC.8 [Obligation to take provisional measures] and LAW.CONFISC.9 [Execution of provisional measures] may also be refused if the measures sought or any other measures having similar effects would not be permitted under the domestic law of the requesting State, or, as regards the competent authorities of the requesting State, if the request is not authorised by a judicial authority acting in relation to criminal offences.

5. Cooperation under Articles LAW.CONFISC.10 [Obligation to confiscate] to LAW.CONFISC.14 [Imprisonment in default] may also be refused if:
    (a) under the domestic law of the requested State, confiscation is not provided for in respect of the type of offence to which the request relates;
    (b) without prejudice to the obligation pursuant to Article LAW.CONFISC.10(3) [Obligation to confiscate], it would be contrary to the principles of the domestic law of the requested State concerning the limits of confiscation in respect of the relationship between an offence and:
        (i) an economic advantage that might be qualified as its proceeds; or
        (ii) property that might be qualified as its instrumentalities;
    (c.) under the domestic law of the requested State, confiscation may no longer be imposed or enforced because of the lapse of time;
    (d) without prejudice to Article LAW.CONFISC.10 (5) and (6) [Obligation to confiscate], the request does not relate to a previous conviction, or a decision of a judicial nature or a statement in such a decision that an offence or several offences have been committed, on the basis of which the confiscation has been ordered or is sought;
    (e) confiscation is either not enforceable in the requesting State, or it is still subject to ordinary means of appeal; or
    (f) the request relates to a confiscation order resulting from a decision rendered in absentia of the person against whom the order was issued and, in the opinion of the requested State, the proceedings conducted by the requesting State leading to such decision did not satisfy the minimum rights of defence recognised as due to everyone against whom a criminal charge is made.

6. For the purposes of point (f) of paragraph 5 a decision is not considered to have been rendered in absentia if:
    (a) it has been confirmed or pronounced after opposition by the person concerned; or
    (b) it has been rendered on appeal, provided that the appeal was lodged by the person concerned.

7. When considering, for the purposes of point (f) of paragraph 5, whether the minimum rights of defence have been satisfied, the requested State shall take into account the fact that the person concerned has deliberately sought to evade justice or the fact that that person, having had the possibility of lodging a legal remedy against the decision made in absentia, elected not to do so. The same applies where the person concerned, having been duly served with the summons to appear, elected not to do so nor to ask for adjournment.

8. The States shall not invoke bank secrecy as a ground to refuse any cooperation under this Title. Where its domestic law so requires, a requested State may require that a request for cooperation which would involve the lifting of bank secrecy be authorised by a judicial authority acting in relation to criminal offences.

9. The requested State shall not invoke the fact that:
    (a) the person under investigation or subject to a confiscation order by the authorities of the requesting State is a legal person as an obstacle to affording any cooperation under this Title;
    (b) the natural person against whom an order of confiscation of proceeds has been issued has died or a legal person against whom an order of confiscation of proceeds has been issued has subsequently been dissolved as an obstacle to affording assistance in accordance with point (a) of Article LAW.CONFISC.10(1) [Obligation to confiscate]; or
    (c.) the person under investigation or subject to a confiscation order by the authorities of the requesting State is mentioned in the request both as the author of the underlying criminal offence and of the offence of money laundering as an obstacle to affording any cooperation under this Title.

##### Article LAW.CONFISC.16: Consultation and information
Where there are substantial grounds for believing that the execution of a freezing or confiscation order would entail a real risk for the protection of fundamental rights, the requested State shall, before it decides on the execution of the freezing or confiscation order, consult the requesting State and may require any necessary information to be provided.

In the latter case, only the Titles referred to in the second notification shall provisionally cease to apply.
