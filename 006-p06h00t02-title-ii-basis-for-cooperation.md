## TITLE II: BASIS FOR COOPERATION

#### Article COMPROV.4: Democracy, rule of law and human rights

1. The Parties shall continue to uphold the shared values and principles of democracy, the rule of law, and respect for human rights, which underpin their domestic and international policies. In that regard, the Parties reaffirm their respect for the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the international human rights treaties to which they are parties.

2. The Parties shall promote such shared values and principles in international forums. The Parties shall cooperate in promoting those values and principles, including with or in third countries.

#### Article COMPROV.5: Fight against climate change

1. The Parties consider that climate change represents an existential threat to humanity and reiterate their commitment to strengthening the global response to this threat. The fight against human-caused climate change as elaborated in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) process, and in particular in the Paris Agreement adopted by the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change at its 21st session (the "Paris Agreement”), inspires the domestic and external policies of the Union and the United Kingdom. Accordingly, each Party shall respect the Paris Agreement and the process set up by the UNFCCC and refrain from acts or omissions that would materially defeat the object and purpose of the Paris Agreement.

2. The Parties shall advocate the fight against climate change in international forums, including by engaging with other countries and regions to increase their level of ambition in the reduction of greenhouse emissions.

#### Article COMPROV.6: Countering proliferation of weapons of mass destruction

1. The Parties consider that the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and their means of delivery, to both state and non-state actors, represents one of the most serious threats to international stability and security. The Parties therefore agree to cooperate and to contribute to countering the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery through full compliance with and national implementation of existing obligations under international disarmament and non-proliferation treaties and agreements and other relevant international obligations.

2. The Parties, furthermore, agree to cooperate on and to contribute to countering the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery by:
    (a) taking steps to sign, ratify, or accede to, as appropriate, and fully implement all other relevant international instruments; and
    (b) establishing an effective system of national export controls, controlling the export as well as transit of WMD-related goods, including a WMD end-use control on dual use technologies and containing effective sanctions for breaches of export controls.

3. The Parties agree to establish a regular dialogue on those matters.

#### Article COMPROV.7: Small arms and light weapons and other conventional weapons

1. The Parties recognise that the illicit manufacture, transfer and circulation of small arms and light weapons (SALW), including their ammunition, their excessive accumulation, their poor management, inadequately secured stockpiles and their uncontrolled spread continue to pose a serious threat to peace and international security.

2. The Parties agree to observe and fully implement their respective obligations to deal with the illicit trade in SALW, including their ammunition, under existing international agreements and UN Security Council resolutions, as well as their respective commitments within the framework of other international instruments applicable in this area, such as the UN Programme of Action to prevent, combat and eradicate the illicit trade in SALW in all its aspects.

3. The Parties recognise the importance of domestic control systems for the transfer of conventional arms in line with existing international standards. The Parties recognise the importance of applying such controls in a responsible manner, as a contribution to international and regional peace, security and stability, and to the reduction of human suffering, as well as to the prevention of diversion of conventional weapons.

4. The Parties undertake, in that regard, to fully implement the Arms Trade Treaty and to cooperate with each other within the framework of that Treaty, including in promoting the universalisation and full implementation of that Treaty by all UN member states.

5. The Parties therefore undertake to cooperate in their efforts to regulate or improve the regulation of international trade in conventional arms and to prevent, combat and eradicate the illicit trade in arms.

6. The Parties agree to establish a regular dialogue on those matters.

#### Article COMPROV.8: The most serious crimes of concern to the international community

1. The Parties reaffirm that the most serious crimes of concern to the international community as a whole must not go unpunished and that their effective prosecution must be ensured by taking measures at the national level and by enhancing international cooperation, including with the International Criminal Court. The Parties agree to fully support the universality and integrity of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court and related instruments.

2. The Parties agree to establish a regular dialogue on those matters.

#### Article COMPROV.9: Counter-terrorism

1. The Parties shall cooperate at the bilateral, regional and international levels to prevent and combat acts of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations in accordance with international law, including, where applicable, international counterterrorism-related agreements, international humanitarian law and international human rights law, as well as in accordance with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations.

2. The Parties shall enhance cooperation on counter-terrorism, including preventing and countering violent extremism and the financing of terrorism, with the aim of advancing their common security interests, taking into account the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy and relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions, without prejudice to law enforcement and judicial cooperation in criminal matters and intelligence exchanges.

3. The Parties agree to establish a regular dialogue on those matters. This dialogue will, inter alia, aim to promote and facilitate:
    (a) the sharing of assessments on the terrorist threat;
    (b) the exchange of best practices and expertise on counter terrorism;
    (c.) operational cooperation and exchange of information; and
    (d) exchanges on cooperation in the framework of multilateral organisations.

#### Article COMPROV.10: Personal data protection

1. The Parties affirm their commitment to ensuring a high level of personal data protection. They shall endeavour to work together to promote high international standards.

2. The Parties recognise that individuals have a right to the protection of personal data and privacy and that high standards in this regard contribute to trust in the digital economy and to the development of trade, and are a key enabler for effective law enforcement cooperation. To that end, the Parties shall undertake to respect, each in the framework of their respective laws and regulations, the commitments they have made in this Agreement in connection with that right.

3. The Parties shall cooperate at bilateral and multilateral levels, while respecting their respective laws and regulations. Such cooperation may include dialogue, exchanges of expertise, and cooperation on enforcement, as appropriate, with respect to personal data protection.

4. Where this Agreement or any supplementing agreement provide for the transfer of personal data, such transfer shall take place in accordance with the transferring Party’s rules on international transfers of personal data. For greater certainty, this paragraph is without prejudice to the application of any specific provisions in this Agreement relating to the transfer of personal data, in particular Article DIGIT.7 [Protection of personal data and privacy] and Article LAWGEN.4 [Protection of personal data], and to Title I of Part Six [Dispute Settlement]. Where needed, each Party will make best efforts, while respecting its rules on international transfers of personal data, to establish safeguards necessary for the transfer of personal data, taking into account any recommendations of the Partnership Council under point (h) of Article INST.1(4) [Partnership Council].

#### Article COMPROV.11: Global cooperation on issues of shared economic, environmental and social interest

1. The Parties recognise the importance of global cooperation to address issues of shared economic, environmental and social interest. Where it is in their mutual interest, they shall promote multilateral solutions to common problems.

2. While preserving their decision-making autonomy, and without prejudice to other provisions of this Agreement or any supplementing agreement, the Parties shall endeavour to cooperate on current and emerging global issues of common interest such as peace and security, climate change, sustainable development, cross-border pollution, environmental protection, digitalisation, public health and consumer protection, taxation, financial stability, and free and fair trade and investment. To that end, they shall endeavour to maintain a constant and effective dialogue and to coordinate their positions in multilateral organisations and forums in which the Parties participate, such as the United Nations, the Group of Seven (G-7) and the Group of Twenty (G-20), the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the World Trade Organization.

#### Article COMPROV.12: Essential elements

Article COMPROV.4(1) [Democracy, rule of law and human rights], Article COMPROV.5(1) [Fight against climate change] and Article COMPROV.6(1) [Countering proliferation of weapons of mass destruction] constitute essential elements of the partnership established by this Agreement and any supplementing agreement.
