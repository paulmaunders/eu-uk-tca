Article 6 - Conditions relating to the requirement of good repute
 
1. Subject to paragraph 2, the Parties shall determine the conditions to be met by natural or
legal persons and transport managers in order to fulfil the requirement of good repute.

In determining whether a natural or legal person has fulfilled that requirement, the Parties shall
consider the conduct of the natural or legal person, its transport managers, executive directors and
any other relevant person as may be determined by the Party. Any reference in this Article to
convictions, penalties or infringements shall include convictions, penalties or infringements of the
natural or legal person itself, its transport managers, executive directors and any other relevant
person as may be determined by the Party.

The conditions referred to in the first part of this paragraph shall include at least the following:

(a) that there be no compelling grounds for doubting the good repute of the transport
manager or the road haulage operator, such as convictions or penalties for any serious
infringement of national rules in force in the fields of:

 
(i) commercial law;
 
 
(ii) insolvency law;
 
 
(iii) pay and employment conditions in the profession;
 
 
(iv) road traffic;
 
 
(v) professional liability;
 
 
(vi) trafficking in human beings or drugs;
 
 
(vii) tax law; and
 
(b) that the transport manager or the road haulage operator have not in one or both Parties

infringement of the rules of Title I of Heading Three of Part Two [Transport of goods by
road] of this Agreement or of national rules relating in particular to:


 
(i) the driving time and rest periods of drivers, working time and the installation

(xi) the posting of workers in road transport;
 
 
(xii) the law applicable to contractual obligations; and
 
 
(xiii) journeys whose points of loading and unloading are situated in the other

2. For the purposes of point (b) of the third subparagraph of paragraph 1 of this Article, where
the transport manager or the road haulage operator has been convicted of a serious criminal offence
or has incurred a penalty for one of the most serious infringements as set out in Appendix
ROAD.A.1.1 in one or both Parties, the competent authority in the Party of establishment shall carry
out and complete in an appropriate and timely manner an administrative procedure, which shall
include, if appropriate, an on-site inspection at the premises of the natural or legal person
concerned.

During the administrative procedure, the competent authority shall assess whether, due to specific
circumstances, the loss of good repute would constitute a disproportionate response in the
individual case. In that assessment, the competent authority shall take into account the number of
serious infringements of the rules as referred to in the third subparagraph of paragraph 1 of this
Article, as well as the number of most serious infringements as set out in Appendix ROAD.A.1.1 for
which the transport manager or the road haulage operator have been convicted or had penalties
imposed on them. Any such finding shall be duly reasoned and justified.

Where the competent authority finds that the loss of good repute would be disproportionate, it shall
decide that the natural or legal person concerned continues to be of good repute. Where the
competent authority does not find that the loss of good repute would be disproportionate, the
conviction or penalty shall lead to the loss of good repute.

3. The Specialised Committee on Road Transport shall draw up a list of categories, types and
degrees of seriousness of serious infringements which, in addition to those set out in Appendix
ROAD.A.1.1, may lead to the loss of good repute.


4. The requirement of good repute shall not be fulfilled until a rehabilitation measure or any
other measure having an equivalent effect has been taken pursuant to the relevant provisions of
national law of the Parties.

 
Article 7 - Conditions relating to the requirement of financial standing
 
1. In order to fulfil the requirement of financial standing, a natural or legal person shall, on a
permanent basis, be able to meet its financial obligations in the course of the annual accounting

GBP 4 500 for each additional motor vehicle or combination of vehicles used that has a
permissible laden mass exceeding 3.5 tonnes and EUR 900 / GBP 800 for each additional
motor vehicle or combination of vehicles that has a permissible laden mass, exceeding 2.5
tonnes but not 3.5 tonnes;

an undertaking demonstrate its financial standing by means of a certificate determined by the
competent authority, such as a bank guarantee or an insurance, including a professional liability
insurance from one or more banks or other financial institutions including insurance companies or
another binding document providing a joint and several guarantee for the undertaking in respect of
the amounts specified in point (a) of paragraph 1.

year of an undertaking's registration, the competent authority shall agree that an undertaking is to
demonstrate its financial standing by means of a certificate, such as a bank guarantee, a document
issued by a financial institution establishing access to credit in the name of the undertaking, or
another binding document as determined by the competent authority proving that the undertaking
has at its disposal the amounts specified in point (a) of paragraph 1.
4. The annual accounts referred to in paragraph 1, and the guarantee referred to in paragraph
2, which are to be verified, are those of the economic entity established in the Party in which an
authorisation has been applied for and not those of any other entity established in the other Party.

(b) Where an oral examination is organised, the Parties may stipulate that participation is
subject to the successful completion of the written examination.

2. Where the Parties also organise an oral examination, they must provide, in respect of each
of the three tests, for a weighting of marks of a minimum of 25 % and a maximum of 40 % of the
total number of marks to be given.


Where the Parties organise only a written examination, they must provide, in respect of each test,
for a weighting of marks of a minimum of 40 % and a maximum of 60 % of the total number of marks

## Section 2. Posting of drivers

 
Article 1 - Subject matter
 
This Section lays down requirements for road haulage operators established in one of the Parties
which, in the framework of the transport of goods, post drivers to the territory of the other Party in
accordance with Article 3 of this Section.

Nothing in this Section shall prevent a Party from applying measures to regulate the entry of natural
persons into, or their temporary stay in, its territory, including measures necessary to protect the
integrity of its borders and to ensure the orderly movement of natural persons across them,
provided that such measures are not applied in such a manner as to nullify or impair the benefits
accruing to the other Party under the terms of this Section. The sole fact of requiring a visa for
natural persons of certain countries and not for those of others shall not be regarded as nullifying or
impairing benefits under this Section.

Nothing in this Section shall affect the application on the Union territory of the Union rules on the
posting of drivers in road transport to Union road haulage operators.

 
Article 2 - Definitions
 
For the purposes of this Section, "posted driver" means a driver who, for a limited period, carries out
his or her work in the territory of a Party other than the Party in which the driver normally works.

 
Article 3 - Principles
 
1. The provisions of this Section apply to the extent that the road haulage operator posts
drivers to the territory of the other Party on its account and under its direction, under a contract
concluded between the road haulage operator making the posting and the party for whom the
transport services are intended, and those drivers operate in the territory of that Party, provided
that there is an employment relationship between the road haulage operator making the posting
and the driver during the period of posting.
2. For the purposes of paragraph 1, a posting shall be considered to start when the driver
enters the territory of the other Party for the loading and/or unloading of goods and to end when
the driver leaves the territory of that Party.

For the purposes of paragraph 1, in the case of posting in the Union, a posting shall, be considered to
start when the driver enters the territory of a Member State for the loading and/or unloading of
goods in that Member State and to end when the driver leaves the territory of that Member State.

3. Notwithstanding the paragraphs 1 and 2, a driver shall not be considered to be posted when
performing transport operations, based on a transport contract, as defined in point (a) of Article
ROAD.4(1) [Transport of goods between, through and within the territories of the Parties] of this
Agreement.
4. A driver shall not be considered to be posted in the United Kingdom where the driver
transits through the territory of the United Kingdom without loading or unloading of goods. For the
Union, a driver shall not be considered to be posted in a Member State when the driver transits
through the territory of that Member State without loading or unloading of goods.

 
Article 4 - Terms and conditions of employment
 

1. Each Party shall ensure, irrespective of which law applies to the employment relationship, that
road haulage operators guarantee, on the basis of equality of treatment, to drivers who are posted
to their territory the terms and conditions of employment covering the following matters which, in
the Party or, in the case of the Union, in the Member State where the work is carried out, are laid
down:

— by law, regulation or administrative provision; and/or

— by collective agreements or arbitration awards which have been declared universally applicable or
otherwise apply in accordance with paragraph 4:

(a) maximum work periods and minimum rest periods;

(b) minimum paid annual leave;

(c) remuneration, including overtime rates; this point does not apply to supplementary
occupational retirement pension schemes;

(d) health, safety and hygiene at work;

(e) protective measures with regard to the terms and conditions of employment of pregnant

 
women or women who have recently given birth, of children and of young people; and
 
(f) equality of treatment between men and women and other provisions on non-

 
discrimination.
 
2. For the purposes of this Section, the concept of remuneration shall be determined by the
national law and/or practice of the Party and, in the case of the Union, by the national law and/or
practice of the Member State, to whose territory the driver is posted and means all the constituent
elements of remuneration rendered mandatory by national law, regulation or administrative
provision, or by collective agreements or arbitration awards which, in that Party or in that Member
State, have been declared universally applicable or otherwise apply in accordance with paragraph 4.
3. Allowances specific to the posting shall be considered to be part of remuneration, unless
they are paid in reimbursement of expenditure actually incurred on account of the posting, such as
expenditure on travel, board and lodging. The road haulage operator shall reimburse the posted
driver for such expenditure in accordance with the law and/or practice applicable to the
employment relationship.

Where the terms and conditions of employment applicable to the employment relationship do not
determine which elements of the allowance specific to the posting are paid in reimbursement of
expenditure actually incurred on account of the posting or which are part of remuneration, then the
entire allowance shall be considered to be paid in reimbursement of expenditure.

4. For the purpose of this Section, "collective agreements or arbitration awards which have
been declared universally applicable" means collective agreements or arbitration awards which must
be observed by all undertakings in the geographical area and in the profession or industry
concerned.

In the absence of, or in addition to, a system for declaring collective agreements or arbitration
awards to be of universal application within the meaning of the first part of this paragraph, each
Party, or each Member State in the case of the Union, may, if they so decide, base themselves on:


— collective agreements or arbitration awards which are generally applicable to all similar
undertakings in the geographical area and in the profession or industry concerned; and/or

— collective agreements which have been concluded by the most representative employers' and
labour organisations at national level and which are applied throughout national territory.

Equality of treatment, within the meaning of paragraph 1, shall be deemed to exist where national
undertakings in a similar position:

 
(i) are subject, in the place in question or in the sector concerned, to the same
obligations as posting undertakings as regards the matters listed in the first
subparagraph of paragraph 1; and
(ii) are required to fulfil such obligations with the same effects.
 
 
Article 5 - Improved access to information
 
1. Each Party or, in the case of the Union, each Member State shall publish the information on
the terms and conditions of employment, in accordance with national law and/or practice, without
undue delay and in a transparent manner, on a single official national website, including the
constituent elements of remuneration as referred to in Article 4(2) and all the terms and conditions
of employment in accordance with Article 4(1).

Each Party or, in the case of the Union, each Member State shall ensure that the information
provided on the single official national website is accurate and up to date.

2. Each Party or, in the case of the Union, each Member State shall take the appropriate
measures to ensure that the information mentioned in paragraph 1 is made generally available free
of charge in a clear, transparent, comprehensive and easily accessible way at a distance and by
electronic means, in formats and in accordance with web accessibility standards that ensure access
to persons with disabilities and to ensure that competent national bodies are in a position to carry
out their tasks effectively.
3. Where, in accordance with national law, traditions and practice, including respect for the
autonomy of social partners, the terms and conditions of employment referred to in Article 4 are
laid down in collective agreements in accordance with Article 4(1), each Party or, in the case of the
Union, each Member State shall ensure that those terms and conditions are made available in an
accessible and transparent way to service providers from the other Party and to posted drivers, and
shall seek the involvement of the social partners in that respect. The relevant information should, in
particular, cover the different minimum rates of pay and their constituent elements, the method
used to calculate the remuneration due and, where relevant, the qualifying criteria for classification
in the different wage categories.
4. Where, contrary to paragraph 1, the information on the single official national website does
not indicate which terms and conditions of employment are to be applied, that circumstance shall be
taken into account in accordance with national law and/or practice in determining penalties in the
event of infringements to this Section, to the extent necessary to ensure the proportionality of those
penalties.
5. Each Party or, in the case of the Union, each Member State shall indicate the bodies and
authorities to which drivers and road haulage operators can turn for general information on national
law and practice applicable to them concerning their rights and obligations within their territory.


 
Article 6 - Administrative requirements, control and enforcement
 
1. Each Party or, in the case of the Union, each Member State may only impose the following
administrative requirements and control measures with respect to the posting of drivers:

(a) an obligation for the operator established in the other Party to submit a posting
declaration to the national competent authorities of the Party or, in the case of the Union,
of the Member State to which the driver is posted at the latest at the commencement of
the posting, using from 2 February 2022 a multilingual standard form of the public
interface connected to the EU Internal Market Information System^136 for administrative
cooperation (IMI); that posting declaration shall consist of the following information:

 
(i) the identity of the operator, at least in the form of the number of the valid licence
where this number is available;
 
 
(ii) the contact details of a transport manager or other contact person in the Party of
establishment or, in the case of the Union, in the Member State of establishment
to liaise with the competent authorities of the host Party or in, the case of the
Union, of the Member State in which the services are provided and to send out and
receive documents or notices;
 
 
(iii) the identity, the address of the residence and the number of the driving licence of
the driver;
 
 
(iv) the start date of the driver's contract of employment, and the law applicable to it;
 
 
(v) the envisaged start and end date of the posting; and
 
 
(vi) the number plates of the motor vehicles;
 
(b) an obligation for the operator to ensure that the driver has at his or her disposal in paper

 
or electronic form and an obligation for the driver to keep and make available when
requested at the roadside:
 
 
(i) a copy of the posting declaration submitted, via the IMI system from 2 February
2022;
 
 
(ii) evidence of the transport operations taking place in the host Party, such as an
electronic consignment note (e-CMR); and
 
 
(iii) the tachograph records and in particular the country symbols of the Party or, in the
case of the Union, of the Member State in which the driver was present when
carrying out transport operations, in accordance with registration and record-
keeping requirements under Section 2 of Part B and Section 4 of Part B;
 
(c) an obligation for the operator to send, from 2 February 2022 via the public interface
connected to the IMI system, after the period of posting, at the direct request of the
competent authorities of the other Party or, in the case of the Union, of a Member State
where the posting took place, copies of documents referred to in point (b) (ii) and (iii) of

(^136) Established by Regulation (EU) 1024/2012.


 
this paragraph as well as documentation relating to the remuneration of the driver in
respect of the period of posting, the employment contract or an equivalent document,
time-sheets relating to the driver's work, and proof of payments.
 
The operator shall send the documentation, from 2 February 2022 via the public interface connected
to the IMI system, no later than eight weeks from the date of the request. If the operator fails to
submit the requested documentation within that time period, the competent authorities of the
Party or, in the case of the Union, the Member State where the posting took place may request,
from 2 February 2022 via the IMI system, the assistance of the competent authorities of the Party of
establishment or, in the case of the Union, the Member State of establishment. When such a
request for mutual assistance is made, the competent authorities of the Party of establishment or, in
the case of the Union, the Member State of establishment of the operator shall have access to the
posting declaration and other relevant information submitted by the operator, from 2 February 2022
via the public interface connected to the IMI system.

The competent authorities of the Party of establishment or, in the case of the Union, of the Member
State of establishment shall ensure that they provide the requested documentation to the
competent authorities of the Party or, in the case of the Union, to the competent authorities of the
Member State where the posting took place, from 2 February 2022 via the IMI system, within 25
working days from the day of the request for mutual assistance.

Each Party shall ensure that the information exchanged by the competent national authorities or
transmitted to them shall be used only in respect of the matter or matters for which it was
requested.

Mutual administrative cooperation and assistance shall be provided free of charge.

A request for information shall not preclude the competent authorities from taking measures to
investigate and prevent alleged breaches of this Section.

3. For the purpose of ascertaining whether a driver is not to be considered to be posted
pursuant to Article 1, each Party may only impose as a control measure an obligation for the driver
to keep and make available, where requested at the roadside check, in paper or electronic form, the
evidence of the relevant transport operations, such as an electronic consignment note (e-CMR), and
tachograph records, as referred to in point (b)(iii) of paragraph 2 of this Article.
4. For the purposes of control, the operator shall keep the posting declarations referred to in
point (a) of paragraph 2 up to date, from 2 February 2022 in the public interface connected to IMI.
5. The information from the posting declarations shall be saved, from 2 February 2022, in the
IMI repository for the purpose of checks for a period of 24 months.
6. The Party or, in the case of the Union, the Member State to whose territory the driver is
posted and the Party or, in the case of the Union, the Member State from which the driver is posted
shall be responsible for the monitoring, control and enforcement of the obligations laid down in this
Section and shall take appropriate measures in the event of failure to comply with this Section.
7. Each Party or, in the case of the Union, the Member States shall ensure that inspections and
controls of compliance under this Article are not discriminatory and/or disproportionate, whilst
taking into account the relevant provisions of this Section.


8. For the enforcement of the obligations under this Section, each Party or, in the case of the
Union, the Member States shall ensure that there are effective mechanisms for posted drivers to
lodge complaints against their employers directly, as well as the right to institute judicial or
administrative proceedings, also in the Party in whose territory the drivers are or were posted,
where such drivers consider they have sustained loss or damage as a result of a failure to apply the
applicable rules, even after the relationship in which the failure is alleged to have occurred has
ended.
9. Paragraph 8 shall apply without prejudice to the jurisdiction of the courts of each Party or, in
case of the Union, the Member States as laid down, in particular, in the relevant instruments of
Union law and/or international conventions.
10. Each Party or, in the case of the Union, the Member States shall lay down the rules on
penalties applicable to infringements of national provisions adopted pursuant to this Section and
shall take all measures necessary to ensure that they are implemented and complied with. The
penalties provided for shall be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.

Each Party shall notify those provisions to the other Party by 30 June 2021. They shall notify without
delay any subsequent amendments to them.

 
Article 7 - Use of the IMI system
 
1. As from 2 February 2022, information, including personal data, referred to in Article 6 shall
be exchanged and processed in the IMI system, provided that the following conditions are fulfilled:

(a) the Parties provide safeguards that data processed in the IMI system are only used for the
purpose for which they were initially exchanged;

(b) any transfer of personal data to the United Kingdom under this Article may only take place
in accordance with point (c) of Article 23(1) of Regulation (EU) 1024/2012^137 ; and

(c) any transfer of personal data to the Union under this Article may only take place in
accordance with the data protection rules on international transfers of the United
Kingdom.

2. The competent authorities in each Party shall grant and revoke appropriate access rights to
IMI users.
3. IMI users are allowed to access personal data processed in the IMI system only on a need-to-
know basis and exclusively for the purpose of implementation and enforcement of this Section.
4. Each Party or, in the case of the Union, each Member State, may allow the competent
authority to provide national social partners by other means than the IMI system with relevant
information available in the IMI system to the extent necessary for the purpose of checking
compliance with posting rules and in accordance with national law and practices, provided that:

driving licence of category C1, C1+E, C or C+E, or a driving licence recognised as equivalent by the
Specialised Committee on Road Transport, is required.

 
Article 2 - Exemptions
 
A certificate of professional competence (CPC) is not required for drivers of vehicles:

(a) with a maximum authorised speed not exceeding 45 km/h;

(b) used by, or under the control of, the armed forces, civil defence, the fire service, forces

 
responsible for maintaining public order, and emergency ambulance services, when the
carriage is undertaken as a consequence of the tasks assigned to those services;
 
(c) undergoing road tests for technical development, repair or maintenance purposes, or the
drivers of new or rebuilt vehicles which have not yet been put into service;

(d) used in states of emergency or assigned to rescue missions;

(e) carrying material, equipment or machinery to be used by the drivers in the course of their

 
work, provided that driving the vehicles is not the drivers' principal activity; or
 
(f) used, or hired without a driver, by agricultural, horticultural, forestry, farming or fishery

 
undertakings for carrying goods as part of their own entrepreneurial activity, except if
driving is part of the driver's principal activity or the driving exceeds a distance set in
national law from the base of the undertaking which owns, hires or leases the vehicle.
 
 
Article 3 - Qualification and training
 
1. The activity of driving as defined in Article 1 shall be subject to a compulsory initial
qualification and to compulsory periodic training. To that end the Parties shall provide for:

(a) a system of initial qualification corresponding to one of the following two options:

_Section 2: Compulsory initial qualification provided for in point (a) of Article 3(1) of Section 1 of Part B_

A Party may count specific other training related to the transport of goods by road required under its
legislation as part of the training under this Section and under Section 3 of this Appendix.

2.1. Option combining both course attendance and a test

Initial qualification must include the teaching of all subjects in the list under Section 1 of this
Appendix. The duration of that initial qualification must be 280 hours.


Each trainee driver must drive for at least 20 hours individually in a vehicle of the category
concerned which meets at least the requirements for test vehicles.

When driving individually, the trainee driver must be accompanied by an instructor, employed by an
approved training centre. Each trainee driver may drive for a maximum of eight hours of the 20
hours of individual driving on special terrain or on a top-of-the-range simulator so as to assess
training in rational driving based on safety regulations, in particular with regard to vehicle handling
in different road conditions and the way they change with different atmospheric conditions, the
time of day or night, and the ability to optimise fuel consumption.

A Party and, in the case of the Union, a Member State may allow part of the training to be delivered
by the approved training centre by means of ICT tools, such as e-learning, while ensuring that the
high quality and the effectiveness of the training are maintained, and by selecting the subjects
where ICT tools can most effectively be deployed. Reliable user identification and appropriate means
of control shall be required in such a case.

For the drivers referred to in Article 5(4) of Section 1 of Part B the length of the initial qualification
must be 70 hours, including five hours of individual driving.

At the end of that training, the competent authorities in the Parties or the entity designated by them
shall give the driver a written or oral test. The test must include at least one question on each of the
objectives in the list of subjects under Section 1 of this Appendix.

2.2 Option involving a test

The competent authorities in the Parties or the entity designated by them shall organise the
aforementioned theoretical and practical tests to check whether the trainee driver has the level of
knowledge required in Section 1 of this Appendix for the subjects and objectives listed there.

(a) The theoretical test shall consist of at least two parts:

 
(i) questions including multiple-choice questions, questions requiring a direct answer,
or a combination of both; and
 
 
(ii) case studies.
 
The minimum duration of the theoretical test must be four hours.

(b) The practical test shall consist of two parts:

 
(i) a driving test aimed at assessing training in rational driving based on safety
regulations. The test must take place, whenever possible, on roads outside built-up
areas, on fast roads and on motorways (or similar), and on all kinds of urban
highways presenting the different types of difficulties that a driver is liable to
encounter. It would be desirable for that test to take place in different traffic
density conditions. The driving time on the road must be used optimally in order to
assess the candidate in all traffic areas likely to be encountered. The minimum
duration of that test must be 90 minutes;
 
 
(ii) a practical test covering at least points 1.5, 3.2, 3.3 and 3.5 of Section 1 of this
Appendix.
 
The minimum duration of that test must be 30 minutes.


The vehicle used for the practical test must meet at least the requirements for test vehicles.

The practical test may be supplemented by a third test taking place on special terrain or on a top-of
the-range simulator so as to assess training in rational driving based on safety regulations, in
particular with regard to vehicle handling in different road conditions and the way they change with
different atmospheric conditions and the time of day or night.

The duration of that optional test is not fixed. Should the driver undergo such a test, its duration
may be deducted from the 90 minutes of the driving test referred to under (i), but the time
deducted may not exceed 30 minutes.

For the drivers referred to in Article 5(4) of Section 1 of Part B, the theoretical test must be limited to
the subjects, referred to in Section 1 of this Appendix, which are relevant to the vehicles to which
the new initial qualification applies. However, such drivers must undergo the whole practical test.

 
Section 3: Accelerated initial qualification provided for in Article 3(2) of Section 1 of Part B of Annex
ROAD.1
 
Accelerated initial qualification must include the teaching of all subjects in the list in Section 1 of this
Appendix. Its duration must be 140 hours.

Each trainee driver must drive for at least 10 hours individually in a vehicle of the category
concerned which meets at least the requirements for test vehicles.

When driving individually, the trainee driver must be accompanied by an instructor, employed by an
approved training centre. Each trainee driver may drive for a maximum of four hours of the 10 hours
of individual driving on special terrain or on a top-of-the-range simulator so as to assess training in
rational driving based on safety regulations, in particular with regard to vehicle handling in different
road conditions and the way those road conditions change with different atmospheric conditions,
the time of day or night, and the ability to optimise fuel consumption.

The provisions of the fourth paragraph of point 2.1 of Section 2 of this Appendix shall also apply to
the accelerated initial qualification.

For the drivers referred to in Article 5(4) of Section 1 of Part B, the length of the accelerated initial
qualification must be 35 hours, including two-and-a-half hours of individual driving.

At the end of that training, the competent authorities in the Parties or the entity designated by them
shall give the driver a written or oral test. The test must include at least one question on each of the
objectives in the list of subjects under Section 1 of this Appendix.

A Party may count specific other training related to the transport of goods by road required under its
legislation as part of the training under this Section.

 
Section 4: Compulsory periodic training provided for in point (b) of Article 3(1) of Section 1 of Part B
of Annex ROAD.1
 
Compulsory periodic training courses must be organised by an approved training centre. Their
duration must be of 35 hours every five years, given in periods of at least seven hours, which may be
split over two consecutive days. Whenever e- learning is used, the approved training centre shall
ensure that the proper quality of the training is maintained, including by selecting the subjects
where ICT tools can most effectively be deployed. In particular, the Parties shall require reliable user


identification and appropriate means of control. The maximum duration of the e-learning training
shall not exceed 12 hours. At least one of the training course periods shall cover a road safety
related subject. The content of the training shall take into account training needs specific to the
transport operations carried out by the driver and relevant legal and technological developments
and should, as far as possible, take into account specific training needs of the driver. A range of
different subjects should be covered over the 35 hours, including repeat training where it is shown
that the driver needs specific remedial training.

A Party and, in the case of the Union, a Member State may count specific other training related to
the transport of goods by road required under its legislation as part of the training under this
Section.

 
Section 5: Approval of the initial qualification and periodic training
 
5.1. The training centres taking part in the initial qualification and periodic training must be
approved by the competent authorities in the Parties. Approval may be given only in response to a
written application. The application must be accompanied by documents including:

5.1.1. a suitable qualification and training programme specifying the subjects taught and
setting out the proposed implementing plan and teaching methods;

expiry date of the card.

 
Article 6 - Use of driver cards and record sheets
 
1. Drivers shall use record sheets or driver cards every day on which they drive, starting from
the moment they take over the vehicle. The record sheet or driver card shall not be withdrawn
before the end of the daily working period unless its withdrawal is otherwise authorised or is
necessary in order to enter the symbol of the country after having crossed a border. No record sheet
or driver card may be used to cover a period longer than that for which it is intended.
2. Drivers shall adequately protect the record sheets or driver cards, and shall not use dirty or
damaged record sheets or driver cards. The driver shall ensure that, taking into account the length of
the period of service, the printing of data from the tachograph at the request of a control officer can
be carried out correctly in the event of an inspection.
3. When, as a result of being away from the vehicle, a driver is unable to use the tachograph
fitted to the vehicle, the periods of time referred to in points (b)(ii), (b)(iii) and (b)(iv) of paragraph 5
shall:

(a) if the vehicle is fitted with an analogue tachograph, be entered on the record sheet, either
manually, by automatic recording or other means, legibly and without dirtying the record
sheet; or

(b) if the vehicle is fitted with a digital, smart 1 or smart 2 tachograph, be entered onto the

 
driver card using the manual entry facility provided for in the tachograph.
 
Each Party shall not impose on drivers a requirement to present forms attesting to their activities
while away from the vehicle.

4. Where there is more than one driver on board a vehicle fitted with a digital, a smart 1 or
smart 2 tachograph, each driver shall ensure that his or her driver card is inserted into the correct
slot in the tachograph.

Where there is more than one driver on board a vehicle fitted with an analogue tachograph, the
drivers shall amend the record sheets as necessary, so that the relevant information is recorded on
the record sheet of the driver who is actually driving.

5. Drivers shall:

(a) ensure that the time recorded on the record sheet corresponds to the official time in the
country of registration of the vehicle;
(b) operate the switch mechanisms enabling the following periods of time to be recorded

 
separately and distinctly:
 
 
(i) under the sign: driving time,
 
 
(ii) under the sign: 'other work', which means any activity other than

the first journey recorded on the record sheet and then, in the event of a change of
vehicle, during use of the record sheet;
 
(d) the odometer reading:

 
(i) at the start of the first journey recorded on the record sheet;
 
 
(ii) at the end of the last journey recorded on the record sheet;
 
 
(iii) in the event of a change of vehicle during a working day, the reading on the first
vehicle to which the driver was assigned and the reading on the next vehicle;
 
(e) the time of any change of vehicle; and

(f) the symbols of the countries in which the daily working period started and finished. The
driver shall also enter the symbol of the country that the driver enters after crossing a
border of an EU Member State and of the United Kingdom at the beginning of the driver's
first stop in that Member State or the United Kingdom. That first stop shall be made at the
nearest possible stopping place at or after the border. Where the crossing of the border
takes place on a ferry or train, the driver shall enter the symbol of the country at the port
or station of arrival.

7. The driver shall enter in the digital tachograph the symbols of the countries in which the
daily working period started and finished.

From 2 February 2022, the driver shall also enter the symbol of the country that the driver enters
after crossing a border of a Member State and of the United Kingdom at the beginning of the driver's
first stop in that Member State or the United Kingdom. That first stop shall be made at the nearest
possible stopping place at or after the border. Where the crossing of the border takes place on a
ferry or train, the driver shall enter the symbol of the country at the port or station of arrival.

A Member State or the United Kingdom may require drivers of vehicles engaged in transport
operations inside their territory to add more detailed geographic specifications to the country


symbol, provided that each Party notifies in advance the other Party about those detailed
geographic specifications.

It shall not be necessary for drivers to enter the information referred to in the first sentence of the
first subparagraph if the tachograph is automatically recording that location data.

 
Article 7 - Correct use of tachographs
 
1. Transport undertakings and drivers shall ensure the correct functioning and proper use of
digital tachographs and driver cards. Transport undertakings and drivers using analogue tachographs
shall ensure their correct functioning and the proper use of record sheets.
2. It shall be forbidden to falsify, conceal, suppress or destroy data recorded on the record
sheet or stored in the tachograph or on the driver card, or print-outs from the tachograph. Any
manipulation of the tachograph, record sheet or driver card which could result in data and/or
printed information being falsified, suppressed or destroyed shall also be prohibited. No device
which could be used to that effect shall be present on the vehicle.

 
Article 8 - Stolen, lost or defective driver cards
 
1. Issuing authorities of the Parties shall keep records of issued, stolen, lost or defective driver
cards for a period at least equivalent to their period of validity.

driver card for a maximum period of 15 days or for a longer period if that is necessary for the vehicle
to return to the premises where it is based, provided that the driver can prove the impossibility of
producing or using the card during that period.

 
Article 9 - Damaged driver cards and record sheets
 
1. In the event of damage to a record sheet bearing recordings or to a driver card, drivers shall
keep the damaged record sheet or driver card together with any spare record sheet used to replace
it.
2. Where a driver card is damaged, malfunctions, or is lost or stolen, the driver shall:

(a) at the start of his or her journey, print out the details of the vehicle that the driver is
driving, and enter on that printout:


 
(i) details that enable the driver to be identified (name, driver card or driving licence
number), including the driver's signature; and
 
 
(ii) the periods referred to in points (b)(ii), (b)(iii) and (b)(iv) of Article 6(5);
 
(b) at the end of the journey, print out the information relating to periods of time recorded by

Article 12 - Enforcement measures
 
1. Each Party shall adopt all appropriate measures to ensure observance of the provisions of
Section 2 to 4 of Part B, in particular by ensuring annually an adequate level of roadside checks and
checks performed at the premises of undertakings covering a large and representative cross-section
of mobile workers, drivers, undertakings and vehicles of all transport categories falling within the
scope of those Sections.

The competent authorities in each Party shall organise the checks so that:

 
(i) during each calendar year, a minimum of 3% of the days worked by the drivers of
vehicles falling within the scope of Section 2 of Part B applies shall be checked; and
 
 
(ii) at least 30% of the total number of working days checked shall be checked at the
roadside and at least 50% at the premises of undertakings.
 
The elements of roadside checks shall include:

 
(i) daily and weekly driving periods, interruptions and daily and weekly rest periods;
 
 
(ii) the record sheets of the preceding days, which shall be on board the vehicle,
and/or the data stored for the same period on the driver card and/or in the
memory of the tachograph and/or on the printouts, when required; and
 
 
(iii) the correct functioning of the tachograph.
 
Those checks shall be carried out without discrimination among vehicles, undertakings and drivers
whether resident or not, and regardless of the origin or destination of the journey or type of
tachograph.

The elements of checks on the premises of undertakings shall include, in addition to the elements
subject to roadside checks:

 
(i) weekly rest periods and driving periods between those rest periods;
 
 
(ii) fortnightly driving limits;
 
 
(iii) compensation for reduced weekly rest periods in accordance with Article 6(6) and
6(7) of Section 2 of Part B; and
 
 
(iv) use of record sheets and/or vehicle unit and driver card data and printouts and/or
the organisation of drivers' working time.
 
2. If the findings of a roadside check on the driver of a vehicle registered in the territory of the
other Party provide grounds to believe that infringements have been committed which cannot be
detected during the check due to lack of necessary data, the competent authorities in each Party
shall assist each other to clarify the situation. In cases where, to that end, the competent authorities
in a Party carry out a check at the premises of the undertaking, the results of that check shall be
communicated to the competent authorities of the other Party.
3. The competent authorities in the Parties shall work in cooperation with each other in the
organisation of concerted roadside checks.


4. Each Party shall introduce a risk rating system for undertakings based on the relative
number and severity of any infringements, as set out in Appendix ROAD.A.1 and of any
infringements included in the list drawn up by the Specialised Committee on Road Transport under
Article 6(3) of Section 1 of Part A, that an individual undertaking has committed.

5, Undertakings with a high risk rating shall be checked more closely and more often.

6. Each Party and, in the case of the Union, each Member State, shall enable its competent
authorities to impose a penalty on a road haulage operator and/or a driver for an infringement of
the applicable provisions on driving time, breaks and rest periods detected on its territory and for
which a penalty has not already been imposed, even where that infringement has been committed
on the territory of the other Party or, in the case of the Union, the territory of a Member State or of
a third country.

Article 9 - Issuing of driver cards
 
1. Driver cards shall be issued, at the request of the driver, by the competent authority in a
Party where the driver has his normal residence. Where the competent authorities in a Party issuing
the driver card have doubts as to the validity of a statement as to normal residence, or for the
purpose of certain specific controls, they may request any additional information or evidence from
the driver.

 
For the purposes of this Article, "normal residence" means the place where a person usually lives,
that is for at least 185 days in each calendar year, because of personal and occupational ties, or, in
the case of a person with no occupational ties, because of personal ties which show close links
between that person and the place where he is living.
 
 
However, the normal residence of a person whose occupational ties are in a place different from
their personal ties and who consequently lives in turn in different places situated in the two Parties
shall be regarded as being the place of their personal ties, provided that such person returns there
regularly. This last condition need not be complied with where the person is living in a Party in order
to carry out a fixed-term assignment.
 
2. In duly justified and exceptional cases, each Party or, in the case of the Union, a Member
State may issue a temporary and non-renewable driver card valid for a maximum period of 185 days
to a driver who does not have his normal residence in a Party, provided that such driver is in a labour
law relationship with an undertaking established in the issuing Party and, in so far, presents a driver
attestation when required.
3. The competent authorities of the issuing Party shall take appropriate measures to ensure
that an applicant does not already hold a valid driver card and shall personalise the driver card,
ensuring that its data are visible and secure.
4. The driver card shall not be valid for more than five years.
5. A valid driver card shall not be withdrawn or suspended unless the competent authorities of
a Party find that the card has been falsified, or the driver is using a card of which he is not the
holder, or the card held has been obtained on the basis of false declarations and/or forged
documents. If such suspension or withdrawal measures are taken by a Party or, in the case of the
Union, a Member State other than the issuing Party or, in the case of the Union, other than the
issuing Member State, the former shall return the card to the authorities of the Party or, in the case
of the Union, the authorities of the Member State which issued it, as soon as possible, indicating the
reasons for the withdrawal or suspension. If the return of the card is expected to take longer than
two weeks, the suspending or withdrawing Party or, in the case of the Union, the suspending or
withdrawing Member State shall inform the issuing Party or, in the case of the Union, the issuing
Member State within those two weeks of the reasons for suspension or withdrawal.


6. The competent authority of the issuing Party may require a driver to replace the driver card
by a new one if this is necessary to comply with the relevant technical specifications.
7. Each Party shall take all necessary measures to prevent driver cards from being falsified.
8. This Article shall not prevent a Party or, in the case of the Union, a Member State from
issuing a driver card to a driver who has his normal residence in a part of that Party's territory, to
which this Annex does not apply, provided that the relevant provisions of this Section are applied in
such cases.

 
Article 10 - Renewal of driver cards
 
#### 1. Where, in the case of renewals, the Party of the driver's normal residence is different from that

 
which issued his current card, and where the authorities of the former Party are requested to renew
the driver card, they shall inform the authorities which issued the earlier card of the reasons for its
renewal.
 
#### 2. In the event of a request for the renewal of a card which is imminently about to expire, the

 
competent authority shall supply a new card before the expiry date, provided that the request was
sent within the time-limits laid down in Article 5 of Section 4 of Part B of this Annex.
 
 
Article 11 - Stolen, lost or defective driver cards
 
#### 1. Issuing authorities shall keep records of issued, stolen, lost or defective driver cards for a period at

 
least equivalent to their period of validity.
 
#### 2. If the driver card is damaged, malfunctions or is lost or stolen, the competent authorities in the

 
Party of his normal residence shall supply a replacement card within eight working days after their
receipt of a detailed request to that effect.
 
 
Article 12 - Mutual acceptance of driver cards
 
#### 1. Each Party shall accept the driver cards issued by the other Party.

#### 2. Where the holder of a valid driver card issued by a Party has established his normal residence in

 
the other Party and has asked for his card to be exchanged for an equivalent driver card, it shall
be the responsibility of the Party or, in the case of the Union, the Member State which carries out
the exchange to verify whether the card produced is still valid.
 
#### 3. Parties or, in the case of the Union, Member States carrying out an exchange shall return the old

 
card to the authorities of the issuing Party or, in the case of the Union, the issuing Member State
and indicate the reasons for so doing.
 
#### 4. Where a Party or, in the case of the Union, a Member State replaces or exchanges a driver card,

 
the replacement or exchange, and any subsequent replacement or exchange, shall be registered
in that Party or, in the case of the Union, in that Member State.
 

 
Article 13 - Electronic exchange of information on driver cards
 
#### 1. In order to ensure that an applicant does not already hold a valid driver card, Parties or, in the case

 
of the Union, Member States shall maintain national electronic registers containing the following
information on driver cards for a period at least equivalent to the period of validity of those cards:
— surname and first name of the driver;
 
 
— birth date and, if available, place of birth of the driver;
 
 
— valid driving licence number and country of issue of the driving licence (if applicable);
 
 
— status of the driver card; and
 
 
— driver card number.
 
#### 2. The electronic registers of the Parties or, in the case of the Union, the Member States shall be

 
interconnected and accessible throughout the territory of the Parties, using the TACHOnet
messaging system or a compatible system. In the case of the use of a compatible system, the
exchange of electronic data with the other Party shall be possible through the TACHOnet messaging
system.
 
#### 3. When issuing, replacing and, where necessary, renewing a driver card, Parties or, in the case of the

 
Union, Member States shall verify through electronic data exchange that the driver does not already
hold another valid driver card. The data exchanged shall be limited to the data necessary for the
purpose of this verification.
 
#### 4. Control officers may have access to the electronic register in order to check the status of a driver

 
card.
 
 
Article 14 - Settings of tachographs
 
#### 1. Digital tachographs shall not be set in such a way that they automatically switch to a specific

 
category of activity when the vehicle's engine or ignition is switched off, unless the driver remains
able to choose manually the appropriate category of activity.
 
#### 2. Vehicles shall not be fitted with more than one tachograph, except for the purposes of field tests.

#### 3. Each Party shall forbid the production, distribution, advertising and/or selling of devices constructed

 
and/or intended for the manipulation of tachographs.
 
 
Article 15 - Responsibility of road haulage operators
 
#### 1. Road haulage operators shall be responsible for ensuring that their drivers are properly trained and

 
instructed as regards the correct functioning of tachographs, whether digital, smart or analogue,
shall make regular checks to ensure that their drivers make correct use thereof, and shall not give to
their drivers any direct or indirect incentives that could encourage the misuse of tachographs.
 
 
Road haulage operators shall issue a sufficient number of record sheets to drivers of vehicles fitted
with analogue tachographs, taking into account the fact that record sheets are personal in character,
 

 
the length of the period of service and the possible need to replace record sheets which are
damaged or have been taken by an authorised control officer. Road haulage operators shall issue to
drivers only record sheets of an approved model suitable for use in the equipment installed in the
vehicle.
 
 
The road haulage operator shall ensure that, taking into account the length of the period of service,
the printing of data from the tachograph at the request of a control officer can be carried out
correctly in the event of an inspection.
 
#### 2. Road haulage operators shall keep record sheets and printouts, whenever printouts have been made

 
to comply with Article 9 of Section 4 of Part B of this Annex, in chronological order and in a legible
form, for at least a year after their use, and shall give copies to the drivers concerned who request
them. Road haulage operators shall also give copies of data downloaded from driver cards to the
drivers concerned who request them, together with printed paper versions of those copies. Record
sheets, printouts and downloaded data shall be produced or handed over at the request of any
authorised control officer.
 
#### 3. Road haulage operators shall be liable for infringements of this Section and of Section 4 of Part B of

 
this Annex committed by their drivers or by drivers at their disposal. However, each Party may make
such liability conditional on the road haulage operator's infringement of the first subparagraph of
paragraph 1 of this Article and Article 7(1) and (2) of Section 2 of Part B of this Annex.
 
 
Article 16 - Procedures for road haulage operators in the event of malfunctioning equipment
 
#### 1. In the event of the breakdown or faulty operation of a tachograph, the road haulage operator shall

 
have it repaired by an approved fitter or workshop, as soon as circumstances permit.
 
#### 2. If the vehicle is unable to return to the road haulage operator's premises within a period of one

 
week calculated from the day of the breakdown or of the discovery of defective operation, the
repair shall be carried out en route.
 
#### 3. Each Party or, in the case of the Union, the Member States shall give the competent authorities

 
power to prohibit the use of the vehicle in cases where the breakdown or faulty operation has not
been remedied as provided in paragraphs 1 and 2 in so far as this is in accordance with the national
legislation in the Party concerned.
 
 
Article 17 - Procedure for the issuing of tachograph cards
