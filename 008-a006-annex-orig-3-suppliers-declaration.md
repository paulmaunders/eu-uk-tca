## ANNEX ORIG-3: SUPPLIER’S DECLARATION

1. A supplier’s declaration shall have the content set out in this Annex.

2. Except in the cases referred to in point 3, a supplier’s declaration shall be made out by the supplier for each consignment of products in the form provided for in Appendix 1 and annexed to the invoice, or to any other document describing the products concerned in sufficient detail to enable them to be identified.

3. Where a supplier regularly supplies a particular customer with products for which the production carried out in a Party is expected to remain constant for a period of time, that supplier may provide a single supplier’s declaration to cover subsequent consignments of those products (the ‘long-term supplier’s declaration’). A long-term supplier’s declaration is normally valid for a period of up to two years from the date of making out the declaration. The customs authorities of the Party where the declaration is made out may lay down the conditions under which longer periods may be used. The long-term supplier’s declaration shall be made out by the supplier in the form provided for in Appendix 2 and shall describe the products concerned in sufficient detail to enable them to be identified. The supplier shall inform the customer immediately if the long-term supplier’s declaration ceases to apply to the products supplied.

4. The supplier making out a declaration shall be prepared to submit at any time, at the request of the customs authorities of the Party where the declaration is made out, all appropriate documents proving that the information given on that declaration is correct.

#### Footnotes

(1) Where the invoice or other document to which the declaration is annexed relates to different kinds of products, or to products which do not incorporate non-originating materials to the same extent, the supplier must clearly differentiate them.

(2) The information requested does not have to be given unless it is necessary.

__Examples:__
One of the rules for garments of Chapter 62 provides “Weaving combined with making-up including cutting of fabric”. If a manufacturer of such garments in a Party uses fabric imported from the other Party which has been obtained there by weaving non-originating yarn, it is sufficient for the supplier in the latter Party to describe in his declaration the non-originating material used as yarn, without it being necessary to indicate the HS heading and the value of such yarn.

A producer of wire of iron of HS heading 7217 who has produced it from non-originating iron bars should indicate in the second column 'bars of iron'. Where that wire is to be used in the production of a machine for which the rule contains a limitation for all non-originating materials used to a certain percentage value, it is necessary to indicate in the third column the value of non-originating bars.

(3) ‘Value of non-originating materials used’ means the value of the non-originating materials used in the production of the product, which is its customs value at the time of importation, including freight, insurance if appropriate, packing and all other costs incurred in transporting the materials to the importation port in the Party where the producer of the product is located; where the value of the non-originating materials is not known and cannot be ascertained, the first ascertainable price paid for the non-originating materials in the Union or in the United Kingdom is used.

(4) Name and address of the customer

(5) Insert dates

(6) This field may contain an electronic signature, a scanned image or other visual representation of the signer’s handwritten signature instead of original signatures, where appropriate.
