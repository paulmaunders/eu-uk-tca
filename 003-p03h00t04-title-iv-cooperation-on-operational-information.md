    (a) the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences;
    (b) the execution of criminal penalties;
    (c.) safeguarding against, and the prevention of, threats to public safety; and
    (d) the prevention and combating of money laundering and the financing of terrorism.

2. For the purposes of this Title, a “competent authority” means a domestic police, customs or other authority that is competent under domestic law to undertake activities for the purposes set out in paragraph 1.

3. Information, including information on wanted and missing persons as well as objects, may be requested by a competent authority of the United Kingdom or of a Member State, or provided spontaneously to a competent authority of the United Kingdom or of a Member State. Information may be provided in response to a request or spontaneously, subject to the conditions of the domestic law which applies to the providing competent authority and within the scope of its powers.

4. Information may be requested and provided to the extent that the conditions of the domestic law which applies to the requesting or providing competent authority do not stipulate that the request or provision of information has to be made or channelled via judicial authorities.

5. In urgent cases, the providing competent authority shall respond to a request, or provide information spontaneously, as soon as possible.

6. A competent authority of the requesting State may, in accordance with relevant domestic law, at the time of making the request or at a later point in time, seek consent from the providing State for the information to be used for evidential purposes in proceedings before a judicial authority. The providing State may, subject to the conditions set out in Title VIII [Mutual Legal Assistance] and the conditions of the domestic law which applies to it, consent to the information being used for evidential purposes before a judicial authority in the requesting State. Equally, where information is provided spontaneously, the providing State may consent to the information being used for evidential purposes in proceedings before a judicial authority in the receiving State. Where consent is not given under this paragraph, the information received shall not be used for evidential purposes in proceedings before a judicial authority.

7. The providing competent authority may, under relevant domestic law, impose conditions on the use of the information provided.

8. A competent authority may provide under this Title any type of information which it holds, subject to the conditions of the domestic law which applies to it and within the scope of its powers.

This may include information from other sources, only if onward transfer of that information is permitted in the framework under which it was obtained by the providing competent authority.

9. Information may be provided under this Title via any appropriate communication channel, including the secure communication line for the purpose of provision of information through Europol.

10. This Article shall not affect the operation or conclusion of bilateral agreements between the United Kingdom and Member States, provided that the Member States act in compliance with Union law. It shall also not affect any other powers which are available to the competent authorities of the United Kingdom or of the Member States under applicable domestic or international law to provide assistance through the sharing of information for the purposes set out in paragraph 1.
