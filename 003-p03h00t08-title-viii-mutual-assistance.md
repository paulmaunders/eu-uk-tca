## TITLE VIII: MUTUAL ASSISTANCE

##### Article LAW.MUTAS.113: Objective
1. The objective of this Title is to supplement the provisions, and facilitate the application between Member States, on the one side, and the United Kingdom, on the other side, of:
    (a) the European Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters, done at Strasbourg on 20 April 1959 (the "European Mutual Assistance Convention");
    (b) the Additional Protocol to the European Mutual Assistance Convention, done at Strasbourg on 17 March 1978; and
    (c.) the Second Additional Protocol to the European Mutual Assistance Convention, done at Strasbourg on 8 November 2001.

2. This Title is without prejudice to the provisions of Title IX [Exchange of information extracted from the criminal record], which takes precedence over this Title.

##### Article LAW.MUTAS.114: Definition of competent authority
For the purposes of this Title, "competent authority" means any authority which is competent to send or receive requests for mutual assistance in accordance with the provisions of the European Mutual Assistance Convention and its Protocols and as defined by States in their respective declarations addressed to the Secretary General of the Council of Europe. “Competent authority” also includes Union bodies notified in accordance with point (c.) of Article LAW.OTHER.134(7) [Notifications]; with regard to such Union bodies, the provisions of this Title apply accordingly.

##### Article LAW.MUTAS.115: Form for a request for mutual assistance
1. The Specialised Committee on Law Enforcement and Judicial Cooperation shall undertake to establish a standard form for requests for mutual assistance by adopting an annex to this Agreement.

2. If the Specialised Committee on Law Enforcement and Judicial Cooperation has adopted a decision in accordance with paragraph 1, requests for mutual assistance shall be made using the standard form.

3. The Specialised Committee on Law Enforcement and Judicial Cooperation may amend the standard form for requests for mutual assistance as may be necessary.

##### Article LAW.MUTAS.116 Conditions for a request for mutual assistance
1. The competent authority of the requesting State may only make a request for mutual assistance if it is satisfied that the following conditions are met:
    (a) the request is necessary and proportionate for the purpose of the proceedings, taking into account the rights of the suspected or accused person; and
    (b) the investigative measure or investigative measures indicated in the request could have been ordered under the same conditions in a similar domestic case.

2. The requested State may consult the requesting State if the competent authority of the requested State is of the view that the conditions in paragraph 1 are not met. After the consultation, the competent authority of the requesting State may decide to withdraw the request for mutual assistance.

##### Article LAW.MUTAS.117: Recourse to a different type of investigative measure
1. Wherever possible, the competent authority of the requested State shall consider recourse to an investigative measure other than the measure indicated in the request for mutual assistance if:
    (a) the investigative measure indicated in the request does not exist under the law of the requested State; or
    (b) the investigative measure indicated in the request would not be available in a similar domestic case.

2. Without prejudice to the grounds for refusal available under the European Mutual Assistance Convention and its Protocols and under Article LAW.MUTAS.119 [Ne bis in idem], paragraph 1 of this Article does not apply to the following investigative measures, which shall always be available under the law of the requested State:
    (a) the obtaining of information contained in databases held by police or judicial authorities that is directly accessible by the competent authority of the requested State in the framework of criminal proceedings;
    (b) the hearing of a witness, expert, victim, suspected or accused person or third party in the territory of the requested State;
    (c.) any non-coercive investigative measure as defined under the law of the requested State; and
    (d) the identification of persons holding a subscription to a specified phone number or IP address.

3. The competent authority of the requested State may also have recourse to an investigative measure other than the measure indicated in the request for mutual assistance if the investigative measure selected by the competent authority of the requested State would achieve the same result by less intrusive means than the investigative measure indicated in the request.

4. If the competent authority of the requested State decides to have recourse to a measure other than that indicated in the request for mutual assistance as referred to in paragraphs 1 or 3, it shall first inform the competent authority of the requesting State, which may decide to withdraw or supplement the request.

5. If the investigative measure indicated in the request does not exist under the law of the requested State or would not be available in a similar domestic case, and there is no other investigative measure which would have the same result as the investigative measure requested, the competent authority of the requested State shall inform the competent authority of the requesting State that it is not possible to provide the assistance requested.

##### Article LAW.MUTAS.118: Obligation to inform
The competent authority of the requested State shall inform the competent authority of the requesting State by any means and without undue delay if:
    (a) it is impossible to execute the request for mutual assistance due to the fact that the request is incomplete or manifestly incorrect; or
    (b) the competent authority of the requested State, in the course of the execution of the request for mutual assistance, considers without further enquiries that it may be appropriate to carry out investigative measures not initially foreseen, or which could not be specified when the request for mutual assistance was made, in order to enable the competent authority of the requesting State to take further action in the specific case.

##### Article LAW.MUTAS.119: Ne bis in idem
Mutual assistance may be refused, in addition to the grounds for refusal provided for under the European Mutual Assistance Convention and its Protocols, on the ground that the person in respect of whom the assistance is requested and who is subject to criminal investigations, prosecutions or other proceedings, including judicial proceedings, in the requesting State, has been finally judged by another State in respect of the same acts, provided that, if a penalty has been imposed, it has been enforced, is in the process of being enforced or can no longer be enforced under the law of the sentencing State.

##### Article LAW.MUTAS.120: Time limits
1. The requested State shall decide whether to execute the request for mutual assistance as soon as possible and in any event no later than 45 days after the receipt of the request and shall inform the requesting State of its decision.

2. A request for mutual assistance shall be executed as soon as possible and in any event no later than 90 days after the decision referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article or after the consultation referred to in Article LAW.MUTAS.116(2) [Conditions for a request for mutual assistance] has taken place.

3. If it is indicated in the request for mutual assistance that, due to procedural deadlines, the seriousness of the offence or other particularly urgent circumstances, a shorter time limit than that provided for in paragraph 1 or 2 is necessary, or if it is indicated in the request that a measure for mutual assistance is to be carried out on a specific date, the requested State shall take as full account as possible of that requirement.

4. If a request for mutual assistance is made to take provisional measures pursuant to Article 24 of the Second Additional Protocol to the European Mutual Assistance Convention, the competent authority of the requested State shall decide on the provisional measure, and shall communicate that decision to the competent authority of the requesting State, as soon as possible after the receipt of the request. Before lifting any provisional measure taken pursuant to this Article, the competent authority of the requested State, wherever possible, shall give the competent authority of the requesting State an opportunity to present its reasons in favour of continuing the measure.

5. If in a specific case, the time limit provided for in paragraph 1 or 2, or the time limit or specific date referred to in paragraph 3 cannot be met, or the decision on taking provisional measures in accordance with paragraph 4 is delayed, the competent authority of the requested State shall, without delay, inform the competent authority of the requesting State by any means, giving the reasons for the delay, and shall consult with the competent authority of the requesting State on the appropriate timing to execute the request for mutual assistance.

6. The time limits referred to in this Article do not apply if the request for mutual assistance is made in relation to any of the following offences and infringements that fall within scope of the European Mutual Assistance Convention and its Protocols, as defined in the law of the requesting State:
    (a) speeding, if no injury or death was caused to another person and if the excess speed was not significant;
    (b) failure to wear a seatbelt;
    (c.) failure to stop at a red light or other mandatory stop signal;
    (d) failure to wear a safety helmet; or
    (e) using a forbidden lane (such as the forbidden use of an emergency lane, a lane reserved for public transport, or a lane closed down for road works).

7. The Specialised Committee on Law Enforcement and Judicial Cooperation shall keep the operation of paragraph 6 under review. It shall undertake to set time limits for the requests to which paragraph 6 applies within three years of the entry into force of this Agreement, taking into account the volume of requests. It may also decide that paragraph 6 shall no longer apply.

##### Article LAW.MUTAS.121: Transmission of requests for mutual assistance
1. In addition to the channels of communication provided for under the European Mutual Assistance Convention and its Protocols, if direct transmission is provided for under their respective provisions, requests for mutual assistance may also be transmitted directly by public prosecutors in the United Kingdom to competent authorities of the Member States.

2. In addition to the channels of communication provided for under the European Mutual Assistance Convention and its Protocols, in urgent cases, any request for mutual assistance, as well as spontaneous information, may be transmitted via Europol or Eurojust, in line with the provisions in the respective 

## Titles of this Agreement.

##### Article LAW.MUTAS.122: Joint Investigation Teams
