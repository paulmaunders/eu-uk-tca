### ANNEX CUSTMS-1: AUTHORISED ECONOMIC OPERATORS

### Article 1 Criteria for and treatment of Authorised Economic Operators

1. The specified criteria for qualification as an Authorised Economic Operator ("AEO") referred to in
Article CUSTMS.9 [Authorised Economic Operators] of this Agreement, shall be established by the
Parties’ laws, regulations or procedures. The specified criteria, which shall be published, shall
include:

    (a) the absence of any serious infringement or repeated infringements of customs legislation and
taxation rules, including no record of serious criminal offences relating to the economic activity of
the applicant;

    (b) the demonstration by the applicant of a high level of control of his or her operations and of the
flow of goods, by means of a system of managing commercial and, where appropriate, transport
records, which allows appropriate customs controls;

    (c.) financial solvency which shall be deemed to be proven where the applicant has good financial
standing, which enables him or her to fulfil his or her commitments, with due regard to the
characteristics of the type of business activity concerned; and

    (d) appropriate security and safety standards which shall be considered as fulfilled where the
applicant demonstrates that he or she maintains appropriate measures to ensure the security and
safety of the international supply chain including in the areas of physical integrity and access
controls, logistical processes and handling of specific types of goods, personnel and identification of
his or her business partners.

2. The specified criteria for qualification as an AEO shall not be designed or applied so as to afford or
create arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination between operators where the same conditions
prevail. Those criteria shall allow small and medium-sized enterprises to qualify as AEOs.

3. The trade partnership programme referred to in Article CUSTMS.9 [Authorised Economic
Operators] of this Agreement shall include the following treatment:
    (a) taking the AEO status granted by the other Party favourably into account in its risk assessment to
reduce inspections or controls and in other security and safety-related measures;
    (b) giving priority to the inspection of consignments covered by exit or entry summary declarations
lodged by an AEO, if the customs authority decides to proceed with an inspection;
    (c.) taking the AEO status granted by the other Party into account with a view to treating the AEO as
a secure and safe partner when assessing requirements concerning business partners for applicants
under its own Programme; and
    (d) endeavouring to establish a joint business continuity mechanism to respond to disruptions in
trade flows due to increases in security alerts levels, border closures and/or natural disasters,
hazardous emergencies or other major incidents where priority cargos related to AEOs could be
facilitated and expedited to the extent possible by the customs authorities of the Parties.

### Article 2 Mutual recognition and responsibility for implementation

1. AEO Status under the trade partnership programmes of the Union and the United Kingdom are
recognised to be compatible, and holders of the AEO status granted under each programme shall be
treated in a manner consistent with Article 4.

2. The trade partnership programmes concerned are:
    a) The European Union Authorised Economic operator (security and safety). (point (b) of Article 38(2) UCC); and

standards of the SAFE Framework.

2. Each Party may suspend the treatment referred to in paragraph 3 of Article 1 to an AEO under the

authority together with any additional information regarding the basis for suspension, as
appropriate.

3. Each Party shall promptly inform the other Party in cases where it identifies any irregularity
committed by an AEO authorised by the other customs authority to allow it to take an informed
