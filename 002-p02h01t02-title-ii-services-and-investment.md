        (i) a rate or amount of royalty below a certain level; or
        (ii) a given duration of the term of a licence contract.

    (d) restricting the sales of goods or services in its territory that that enterprise produces or supplies by relating those sales in any way to the volume or value of its exports or foreign exchange inflows; or
    (e) restricting the exportation or sale for export.

3. Paragraph 2 shall not be construed as preventing a Party from conditioning the receipt or continued receipt of an advantage, in connection with the establishment or operation of any enterprise in its territory, on compliance with a requirement to locate production, supply a service, train or employ workers, construct or expand particular facilities, or carry out research and development, in its territory.

4. Points (f) and (l) of paragraph 1 do not apply where:
    (a) the requirement is imposed or enforced, or the commitment or undertaking is enforced, by a court or administrative tribunal, or by a competition authority pursuant to a Party’s competition law to prevent or remedy a restriction or a distortion of competition; or
    (b) a Party authorises the use of an intellectual property right in accordance with Article 31 or Article 31bis of the TRIPS Agreement, or adopts or maintains measures requiring the disclosure of data or proprietary information that fall within the scope of, and are consistent with, paragraph 3 of Article 39 of the TRIPS Agreement.

5. Points (a) to (c) of paragraph 1 and points (a) and (b) of paragraph 2 do not apply to qualification requirements for goods or services with respect to participation in export promotion and foreign aid programmes.

7. For greater certainty, points (a) and (b) of paragraph 2 do not apply to requirements imposed by an importing Party in relation to the content of goods necessary to qualify for preferential tariffs or preferential quotas.

8. Point (l) of paragraph 1 does not apply if the requirement is imposed or enforced, or the commitment or undertaking is enforced, by a tribunal as equitable remuneration under the Party's copyright laws.

9. A Party shall neither impose nor enforce any measure inconsistent with its obligations under the Agreement on Trade-Related Investment Measures (TRIMs), even where such measure has been listed by that Party in ANNEX SERVIN-1 [Existing measures] or ANNEX SERVIN-2 [Future measures].

[^10]    For greater certainty, this Article shall not be construed as requiring a Party to permit a particular service to be supplied on a cross-border basis where that Party adopts or maintains restrictions or prohibitions on such provision of services which are consistent with the reservations, conditions or qualifications specified with respect to a sector, subsector or activity listed in ANNEX SERVIN-1 [Existing measures] or ANNEX SERVIN-2 [Future measures].

[^11]    A condition for the receipt or continued receipt of an advantage referred to in paragraph 2 does not constitute a requirement or a commitment or undertaking for the purposes of paragraph 1.

    (c.) a modification to any non-conforming measure referred to in points (a) and (b) of this paragraph, provided that it does not decrease the conformity of the measure, as it existed immediately before the modification, with Articles SERVIN.2.2 [Market access], Article SERVIN.2.3 [National treatment], Articles SERVIN.2.4 [Most favoured nation treatment], SERVIN.2.5 [Senior management and boards of directors] or SERVIN.2.6 [Performance requirements].

4. For greater certainty, Articles SERVIN.2.3 [National treatment] and SERVIN.2.4 [Most favoured nation treatment] shall not be construed as preventing a Party from prescribing information requirements, including for statistical purposes, in connection with the establishment or operation of investors of the other Party or of covered enterprises, provided that it does not constitute a means to circumvent that Party’s obligations under those Articles.

    (a) impose limitations on:
        (i) the number of services suppliers that may supply a specific service, whether in the form of numerical quotas, monopolies, exclusive service suppliers or the requirement of an economic needs test;
        (ii) the total value of service transactions or assets in the form of numerical quotas or the requirement of an economic needs test; or
        (iii) the total number of service operations or on the total quantity of service output expressed in the terms of designated numerical units in the form of quotas or the requirement of an economic needs test13; or
    (b) restrict or require specific types of legal entity or joint venture through which a service supplier may supply a service.

[^13]    Point (a) (iii) of Article SERVIN.3.2 [Market access] does not cover measures by a Party which limit inputs for the supply of services.

3. Formally identical or formally different treatment shall be considered to be less favourable if it modifies the conditions of competition in favour of services or service suppliers of the Party compared to services or service suppliers of the other Party.

3. For greater certainty, the existence of substantive provisions in other international agreements concluded by a Party with a third country, or mere formal transposition of those provisions into domestic law to the extent that it is necessary in order to incorporate them into the domestic legal order, do not in themselves constitute the "treatment" referred to in paragraph 1. Measures of a Party pursuant to those provisions may constitute such treatment and thus give rise to a breach of this Article.

2. This Section does not apply to licensing requirements and procedures, qualification requirements and procedures, formalities and technical standards pursuant to a measure:
    (a) that does not conform with Article SERVIN.2.2 [Market access] or 2.3 [National treatment] and is referred to in points (a) to (c.) of Article SERVIN.2.7(1) [Non-conforming measures and exceptions] or with Article SERVIN.3.2 [Market access], Article SERVIN.3.3 [Local presence] or Article SERVIN.3.4 [National treatment] and is referred to in points (a) to (c.) of Article SERVIN.3.6(1) [Non-conforming measures] or with points (b) and (c.) of Article SERVIN 4.2(1) [Intra-corporate transferees and business visitors for establishment purposes], or Article SERVIN 4.3(3) [Short-term business visitors]] or with points (b) and (c.) of Article SERVIN 4.4(1) [Contractual service suppliers and independent professionals] and is referred to in Article SERVIN 4.5(1) [Non-conforming measures]; or

##### Article SERVIN.5.2: Submission of applications
Each Party shall, to the extent practicable, avoid requiring an applicant to approach more than one competent authority for each application for authorisation. If an activity for which authorisation is requested is within the jurisdiction of multiple competent authorities, multiple applications for authorisation may be required.

##### Article SERVIN.5.3: Application timeframes
If a Party requires authorisation, it shall ensure that its competent authorities, to the extent practicable, permit the submission of an application at any time throughout the year. If a specific time period for applying for authorisation exists, the Party shall ensure that the competent authorities allow a reasonable period of time for the submission of an application.

##### Article SERVIN.5.4: Electronic applications and acceptance of copies
If a Party requires authorisation, it shall ensure that its competent authorities:
    (a) to the extent possible provide for applications to be completed by electronic means, including from within the territory of the other Party; and
    (b) accept copies of documents, that are authenticated in accordance with the Party’s domestic law, in place of original documents, unless the competent authorities require original documents to protect the integrity of the authorisation process.

##### Article SERVIN.5.5: Processing of applications
1. If a Party requires authorisation, it shall ensure that its competent authorities:
    (a) process applications throughout the year. Where that is not possible, this information should be made public in advance, to the extent feasible;
    (b) to the extent practicable, provide an indicative timeframe for the processing of an application. That timeframe shall be reasonable to the extent practicable;
    (c.) at the request of the applicant, provide without undue delay information concerning the status of the application;
    (d) to the extent practicable, ascertain without undue delay the completeness of an application for processing under the Party’s domestic laws and regulations;

        (iii) provide the applicant with the opportunity to provide the additional information that is required to complete the application; [^21]
    however, if none of the above is practicable, and the application is rejected due to incompleteness, competent authorities shall ensure that they inform the applicant within a reasonable period of time; and

2. The Parties shall ensure that their competent authorities grant an authorisation as soon as it is established, on the basis of an appropriate examination, that the applicant meets the conditions for obtaining it.

3. The Parties shall ensure that, once granted, an authorisation enters into effect without undue delay, subject to the applicable terms and conditions. [^22]
4. 
[^19]   Balancing resource constraints against the potential burden on businesses, in cases where it is reasonable to do so, competent authorities may require that all information is submitted in a specified format to consider it "complete for the purposes of processing".
[^20]   Competent authorities may meet the requirement set out in point (ii) by informing an applicant in advance in writing, including through a published measure, that a lack of response after a specified period of time from the date of submission of the application indicates acceptance of the application. The reference to "in writing" should be understood as including electronic format.
[^21]   Such “opportunity” does not require a competent authority to provide extensions of deadlines.
[^22]   Competent authorities are not responsible for delays due to reasons outside their competence.

##### Article SERVIN.5.6: Fees
1. For all economic activities other than financial services, each Party shall ensure that the authorisation fees charged by its competent authorities are reasonable and transparent and do not in themselves restrict the supply of the relevant service or the pursuit of any other economic activity. Having regard to the cost and administrative burden, each Party is encouraged to accept payment of authorisation fees by electronic means.

2. With regard to financial services, each Party shall ensure that its competent authorities, with respect to authorisation fees that they charge, provide applicants with a schedule of fees or information on how fee amounts are determined, and do not use the fees as a means of avoiding the Party’s commitments or obligations.

3. Authorisation fees do not include fees for the use of natural resources, payments for auction, tendering or other non-discriminatory means of awarding concessions or mandated contributions to universal service provision.

##### Article SERVIN.5.7: Assessment of qualifications
If a Party requires an examination to assess the qualifications of an applicant for authorisation, it shall ensure that its competent authorities schedule such an examination at reasonably frequent intervals and provide a reasonable period of time to enable applicants to request to take the examination. To the extent practicable, each Party shall accept requests in electronic format to take such examinations and shall consider the use of electronic means in other aspects of examination processes.

##### Article SERVIN.5.8: Publication and information available
1. If a Party requires authorisation, the Party shall promptly publish the information necessary for persons carrying out or seeking to carry out the activities referred to in Article SERVIN.5.1(1) [Scope and definitions] for which the authorisation is required to comply with the requirements, formalities, technical standards and procedures for obtaining, maintaining, amending and renewing such authorisation. Such information shall include, to the extent it exists:
    (a) the licensing and qualification requirements and procedures and formalities;
    (b) contact information of relevant competent authorities;
    (c.) authorisation fees;
    (d) applicable technical standards;

Parties shall consolidate electronic publications into a single online portal or otherwise ensure that competent authorities make them easily accessible through alternative electronic means.

2. Each Party shall require each of its competent authorities to respond to any request for information or assistance, to the extent practicable.

##### Article SERVIN.5.9: Technical standards
Each Party shall encourage its competent authorities, when adopting technical standards, to adopt technical standards developed through open and transparent processes, and shall encourage any body, including relevant international organisations, designated to develop technical standards to do so through open and transparent processes.

##### Article SERVIN.5.10: Conditions for authorisation
1. Each Party shall ensure that measures relating to authorisation are based on criteria which preclude the competent authorities from exercising their power of assessment in an arbitrary manner and may include, inter alia, competence and the ability to supply a service or any other economic activity, including to do so in compliance with a Party’s regulatory requirements such as health and environmental requirements. For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties understand that in reaching decisions a competent authority may balance criteria.

2. The criteria referred to in paragraph 1 shall be:
    (a) clear and unambiguous;
    (b) objective and transparent;
    (c.) pre-established;
    (d) made public in advance;
    (e) impartial; and
    (f) easily accessible.

3. If a Party adopts or maintains a measure relating to authorisation, it shall ensure that:
    (a) the competent authority concerned processes applications, and reaches and administers its decisions objectively and impartially and in a manner independent of the undue influence of any person carrying out the economic activity for which authorisation is required; and
    (b) the procedures themselves do not prevent fulfilment of the requirements.

##### Article SERVIN.5.11: Limited numbers of licences
If the number of licences available for a given activity is limited because of the scarcity of available natural resources or technical capacity, a Party shall apply a selection procedure to potential candidates which provides full guarantees of impartiality, objectivity and transparency, including, in particular, adequate publicity about the launch, conduct and completion of the procedure. In establishing the rules for the selection procedure, a Party may take into account legitimate policy objectives, including considerations of health, safety, the protection of the environment and the preservation of cultural heritage.

#### Section 2: Provisions of general application

##### Article SERVIN.5.12: Review procedures for administrative decisions
A Party shall maintain judicial, arbitral or administrative tribunals or procedures which provide, on request of an affected investor or service supplier of the other Party, for the prompt review of, and if justified appropriate remedies for, administrative decisions that affect establishment or operation, cross-border trade in services or the supply of a service through the presence of a natural person of a Party in the territory of the other Party. For the purposes of this Section, "administrative decisions" means a decision or action with a legal effect that applies to a specific person, good or service in an individual case and covers the failure to take an administrative decision or take such action when that is so required by a Party’s law. If such procedures are not independent of the competent authority entrusted with the administrative decision concerned, a Party shall ensure that the procedures in fact provide for an objective and impartial review.

##### Article SERVIN.5.13: Professional qualifications
1. Nothing in this Article shall prevent a Party from requiring that natural persons possess the necessary professional qualifications specified in the territory where the activity is performed, for the sector of activity concerned23.

2. The professional bodies or authorities, which are relevant for the sector of activity concerned in their respective territories, may develop and provide joint recommendations on the recognition of professional qualifications to the Partnership Council. Such joint recommendations shall be supported by an evidence-based assessment of:
    (a) the economic value of an envisaged arrangement on the recognition of professional qualifications; and
    (b) the compatibility of the respective regimes, that is, the extent to which the requirements applied by each Party for the authorisation, licensing, operation and certification are compatible.

3. On receipt of a joint recommendation, the Partnership Council shall review its consistency with this Title within a reasonable period of time. The Partnership Council may, following such review, develop and adopt an arrangement on the conditions for the recognition of professional qualifications by decision as an annex to this Agreement, which shall be considered to form an integral part of this Title. [^24]
[^23]   For greater certainty, this Article shall not be construed to prevent the negotiation and conclusion of one or more agreements between the Parties on the recognition of professional qualifications on conditions and requirements different from those provided for in this Article.
[^24]   For greater certainty, such arrangements shall not lead to the automatic recognition of qualifications but shall set, in the mutual interest of both Parties, the conditions for the competent authorities granting recognition.

4. An arrangement referred to under paragraph 3 shall provide for the conditions for recognition of professional qualifications acquired in the Union and professional qualifications acquired in the United Kingdom relating to an activity covered by this Title and Title III [Digital Trade] of Heading One.

5. The Guidelines for arrangements on the recognition of professional qualifications set out in Annex SERVIN-6 [Guidelines for arrangements on the recognition of professional qualifications] shall be taken into account in the development of the joint recommendations referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article and by the Partnership Council when assessing whether to adopt such an Arrangement, as referred to in paragraph 3 of this Article.

3. If a licence application is rejected by the competent authority, it shall inform the applicant of the reasons for the rejection in writing.
