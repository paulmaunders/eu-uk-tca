### Article 3: Objectives

With regard to the products covered the objectives of this Annex are:

    (b) to set out the conditions for the recognition of inspections and for the exchange and acceptance of official GMP documents between the Parties;
    (c.) to promote public health by safeguarding patient safety and animal health and welfare, as well as to protect high levels of consumer and environmental protection, where relevant, by promoting regulatory approaches in line with the relevant international standards.

### Article 4: International standards

The relevant standards for the products covered by this Annex shall ensure a high level of protection of public health in line with standards, practices and guidelines developed by the World Health Organization (WHO), the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH), and the International Cooperation on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Veterinary Medicinal Products (VICH).

### Article 5: Recognition of inspections and acceptance of official GMP documents

1. A Party shall recognise inspections carried out by the other Party and shall accept official GMP documents issued by the other Party in accordance with the laws, regulations and technical guidelines listed in Appendix B.

2. An authority of a Party may in specific circumstances opt not to accept an official GMP document issued by an authority of the other Party for manufacturing facilities located in the territory of the issuing authority. Examples of such circumstances include the indication of material inconsistencies or inadequacies in an inspection report, quality defects identified in post-market surveillance or other specific evidence of serious concern in relation to product quality or patient safety. Each Party shall ensure that where an authority of a Party opts not to accept an official GMP document issued by an authority of the other Party, that authority notifies the relevant authority of the other Party of the reasons for not accepting the document and may request clarification from the authority of the other Party. The relevant Party shall ensure that its authority endeavours to respond to the request for clarification in a timely manner.

3. A Party may accept official GMP documents issued by an authority of the other Party for manufacturing facilities located outside the territory of the issuing authority.

4. Each Party may determine the terms and conditions under which it accepts official GMP documents issued under paragraph 3.

### Article 6: Exchange of official GMP documents

The authority of the Party that intends to conduct the inspection shall endeavour to notify the authority of the other Party in writing at least 30 days before a proposed inspection, but may provide a shorter notice in urgent situations. The authority of the other Party may join the inspection.

2. The Parties shall exchange all the necessary information, including changes to their respective laws, regulations, technical guidelines or inspection procedures relating to Good Manufacturing Practice so that each Party can consider whether the conditions for the recognition of inspections and acceptance of official GMP documents pursuant to Article 5(1) continue to exist.

3. If as a result of any of the new measures or changes referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, a Party considers that it can no longer recognise inspections or accept official GMP documents issued by the other Party, it shall notify the other Party of its intention to apply Article 9 and the Parties shall enter into consultations within the Working Group on Medicinal Products.

4. Any notification under this Article shall be done via the designated contact points in the Working Group on Medicinal Products.

That right shall be exercised in an objective and reasoned manner. The Party exercising such right shall notify the other Party and provide a written justification. A Party shall continue to accept official GMP documents of the other Party issued prior to such suspension, unless the Party decides otherwise on the basis of health or safety considerations.

2. Where, following consultations referred to in Article 8(3), a Party nevertheless suspends the recognition of inspections and acceptance of official GMP documents pursuant to Article 5(1), it may do so in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Article not earlier than 60 days after the commencement of the consultations. During that 60-day period, both Parties shall continue to recognise inspections and accept official GMP documents issued by an authority of the other Party.

3. Where recognition of inspections and acceptance of official GMP documents pursuant to Article 5(1) is suspended, at the request of a Party, the Parties shall discuss the matter within the Working Group on Medicinal Products and they shall make every effort to consider possible measures that would enable the recognition of inspections and acceptance of official GMP documents to be restored.

### Article 10: Regulatory cooperation

1. The Parties shall endeavour to consult one another, as permitted by their respective law, on proposals to introduce significant changes to technical regulations or inspection procedures, including those that affect how documents from the other Party are recognised in accordance with Article 5 and, where appropriate, to provide the opportunity to comment on such proposals, without prejudice to Article 8.
