##### Article LAW.PNR.27: Automated processing of PNR data
1. The United Kingdom competent authority shall ensure that any automated processing of PNR data is based on non-discriminatory, specific and reliable pre-established models and criteria to enable it to:
    (a) arrive at results targeting natural persons who might be under a reasonable suspicion of involvement or participation in terrorism or serious crime; or
    (b) in exceptional circumstances, protect the vital interests of any natural person as set out in Article LAW.PNR.20(2) [Purposes of the use of PNR data].

##### Article LAW.PNR.28: Retention of PNR data
1. The United Kingdom shall not retain PNR data for more than five years from the date that it receives the PNR data.

2. No later than six months after the transfer of the PNR data referred to in paragraph 1, all PNR data shall be depersonalised by masking out the following data elements which could serve to identify directly the passenger to whom the PNR data relate or any other natural person:
    (a) names, including the names of other passengers on the PNR and number of passengers on the PNR travelling together;
    (b) addresses, telephone numbers and electronic contact information of the passenger, the persons who made the flight reservation for the passenger, persons through whom the air passenger may be contacted and persons who are to be informed in the event of an emergency;

3. The United Kingdom competent authority may unmask PNR data only if it is necessary to carry out investigations for the purposes set out in Article LAW.PNR.20 [Purposes of the use of PNR data]. Such unmasked PNR data shall be accessible only to a limited number of specifically authorised officials.

4. Notwithstanding paragraph 1, the United Kingdom shall delete the PNR data of passengers after their departure from the country unless a risk assessment indicates the need to retain such PNR data. In order to establish that need, the United Kingdom shall identify objective evidence from which it may be inferred that certain passengers present the existence of a risk in terms of the fight against terrorism and serious crime.

5. For the purposes of paragraph 4, unless information is available on the exact date of departure, the date of departure should be considered as the last day of the period of maximum lawful stay in the United Kingdom of the passenger concerned.

7. An independent administrative body in the United Kingdom shall assess on a yearly basis the approach applied by the United Kingdom competent authority as regards the need to retain PNR data pursuant to paragraph 4.

8. Notwithstanding paragraphs 1, 2 and 4, the United Kingdom may retain PNR data required for any specific action, review, investigation, enforcement action, judicial proceeding, prosecution, or enforcement of penalties, until concluded.

9. The United Kingdom shall delete the PNR data at the end of the PNR data retention period.

10. Paragraph 11 applies due to the special circumstances that prevent the United Kingdom from making the technical adjustments necessary to transform the PNR processing systems which the United Kingdom operated whilst Union law applied to it into systems which would enable PNR data to be deleted in accordance with paragraph 4.

11. The United Kingdom may derogate from paragraph 4 on a temporary basis for an interim period, the duration of which is provided for in paragraph 13, pending the implementation by the United Kingdom of technical adjustments as soon as possible. During the interim period, the United Kingdom competent authority shall prevent the use of the PNR data that is to be deleted in accordance with paragraph 4 by applying the following additional safeguards to that PNR data:
    (a) the PNR data shall be accessible only to a limited number of authorised officials and only where necessary to determine whether the PNR data should be deleted in accordance with paragraph 4;
    (b) the request to use the PNR data shall be refused in cases where the data is to be deleted in accordance with paragraph 4, and no further access shall be granted to that data where the documentation referred to in point (d) of this paragraph indicates that an earlier request for use has been refused;
    (c.) deletion of the PNR data shall be ensured as soon as possible using best efforts, taking into account the special circumstances referred to in paragraph 10; and
    (d) the following shall be documented in accordance with Article LAW.PNR.30 [Logging and documenting of PNR data processing], and such documentation shall be made available to the independent administrative body referred to in paragraph 7 of this Article:
        (i) any requests to use the PNR data;
        (ii) the date and time of the access to the PNR data for the purpose of assessing whether deletion of the PNR data was required;
        (iii) that the request to use the PNR data was refused on the basis that the PNR data should have been deleted under paragraph 4, including the date and time of the refusal; and
        (iv) the date and time of the deletion of the PNR data in accordance with point (c) of this paragraph.

12. The United Kingdom shall provide to the Specialised Committee on Law Enforcement and Judicial Cooperation, nine months after the entry into force of this Agreement and again a year later if the interim period is extended for a further year:
    (a) a report from the independent administrative body referred to in paragraph 7 of this Article, which shall include the opinion of the United Kingdom supervisory authority referred to in Article LAW.GEN.4(3) [Protection of personal data] as to whether the safeguards provided for in paragraph 11 of this Article have been effectively applied; and

    (b) the assessment of the United Kingdom of whether the special circumstances referred to in paragraph 10 of this Article persist, together with a description of the efforts made to transform the PNR processing systems of the United Kingdom into systems which would enable PNR data to be deleted in accordance with paragraph 4 of this Article.

13. The Specialised Committee on Law Enforcement and Judicial Cooperation shall meet within one year of the entry into force of this Agreement to consider the report and assessment provided under paragraph 12. Where the special circumstances referred to in paragraph 10 persist, the Partnership Council shall extend the interim period referred to in paragraph 11 for one year. The Partnership Council shall extend the interim period for one further final year, under the same conditions and following the same procedure as for the first extension where, in addition, substantial progress has been made, although it has not yet been possible to transform the United Kingdom PNR processing systems into systems which would enable PNR data to be deleted in accordance with paragraph 4.

14. If the United Kingdom considers that a refusal by the Partnership Council to grant either of those extensions was not justified, it may suspend this Title with one month’s notice.

15. On the third anniversary of the date of entry into force of this Agreement, paragraphs 10 to 14 shall cease to apply.

##### Article LAW.PNR.29: Conditions for the use of PNR data

2. Use of PNR data by the United Kingdom competent authority in accordance with paragraph 1 shall be subject to prior review by a court or by an independent administrative body in the United Kingdom based on a reasoned request by the United Kingdom competent authority submitted within the domestic legal framework of procedures for the prevention, detection or prosecution of crime, except:
    (a) in cases of validly established urgency; or
