##### ANNEX ENER-2: ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SUBSIDIES

As part of the principles set out in Article 3.5(14) [Prohibited subsidies and subsidies subject to
conditions (Energy and environment)] of Chapter three [Subsidy control] of Title XI [Level playing
field for open and fair competition and sustainable development] of Heading One [Trade] of Part
Two of this Agreement:

(1) Subsidies for electricity generation adequacy, renewable energy and cogeneration shall not
undermine the ability of a Party to meet its obligations under Article ENER.6 [Provisions
relating to wholesale electricity and gas markets] of this Agreement, shall not unnecessarily
affect the efficient use of electricity interconnectors provided for under Article ENER.13
[Efficient use of electricity interconnectors], and, without prejudice to Article ENER 6(3)
[Provisions relating to wholesale electricity and gas markets] of this Agreement, shall be
determined by means of a transparent, non-discriminatory and effective competitive
process; and

 
(a) subsidies for electricity generation adequacy shall provide incentives for capacity
providers to be available in times of expected system stress and may be limited to
installations not exceeding specified CO 2 emission limits; and
 
 
(b) subsidies for renewable energy and cogeneration shall not affect beneficiariesâ€™
obligations or opportunities to participate in electricity markets.
 
(2) Notwithstanding point 1, provided that appropriate measures are put in place to prevent
overcompensation, non-competitive procedures may be used to grant subsidies for
renewable energy and cogeneration if the potential supply is insufficient to ensure a
competitive process, the eligible capacity is unlikely to have a material effect on trade or
investment between the Parties, or subsidies are granted for demonstration projects.

(3) If partial exemptions from energy-related taxes and levies^134 in favour of energy-intensive
users are introduced, such exemptions shall not exceed the total amount of the tax or levy.

(4) If compensation for electricity-intensive users is granted in the event of an increase in
electricity cost resulting from climate policy instruments, it shall be restricted to sectors at
significant risk of carbon leakage due to the cost increase.

(5) Subsidies for the decarbonisation of emissions linked to own industrial activities shall
achieve an overall reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. The subsidies shall reduce the
emissions directly resulting from the industrial activity. Subsidies for improvements of the
energy efficiency of own industrial activities shall improve energy efficiency by reducing
energy consumption, either directly or per unit of production.

(^134) For greater certainty, levies do not include network charges or tariffs.
